I never used to understand what the fuss was all about Apple and it‚Äôs expensive walled garden ecosystem.Then I got a iPhone 13 and IPad.

Great product and a good gift",N/A,"It is a gift that I got for my mother and I am not an IOS user. Her primary use for it is family connection and browsing, so no high end use. However, the product does make a great gift and is one of the most affordable  models which is currently under production and therefore you can expect a support for next 3 years or so at the very least. I personally love the screen quality and touch sensitivity. The default settings are great. Import data from icloud backup was effortless. Default home screen layout is absolutely intuitive. Overall I am very happy with the product and is perfect set up at 64GB if you are not the heave end user. I opted for WiFi only as I do not expect to not have a mobile hotspot or WiFi home network and therefore SIM option is not really needed for me.

Great product and a good gift",N/A,"It is a gift that I got for my mother and I am not an IOS user. Her primary use for it is family connection and browsing, so no high end use. However, the product does make a great gift and is one of the most affordable  models which is currently under production and therefore you can expect a support for next 3 years or so at the very least. I personally love the screen quality and touch sensitivity. The default settings are great. Import data from icloud backup was effortless. Default home screen layout is absolutely intuitive. Overall I am very happy with the product and is perfect set up at 64GB if you are not the heave end user. I opted for WiFi only as I do not expect to not have a mobile hotspot or WiFi home network and therefore SIM option is not really needed for me. However, that is a personal choice depending on whether the iPad is being used as a primary device for communication."

THE best tablet in this price range!",N/A,"For people who are casual users and consume mainly content like Hotstar, Netflix etc. with a little productive work like word,excel - my advice is simple, close your eyes and go for this tablet . You will not regret it !!For the price of around 28K there is not a single android tablet that can deliver the performance and overall excellent user experience that the IPad does.I come from the world of android - tv, mobile etc.. everything for more than a decade using android. I never used to understand what the fuss was all about Apple and it‚Äôs expensive walled garden ecosystem.Then I got a iPhone 13 and IPad. Initial days was a challenge but later simply fell in love with the entire usage experience of the ios. Everything simply works well, you don‚Äôt have to tinker or customise hundred different things. They just work and work very well! Honestly I don‚Äôt really care about customising everything including the o/s in android, never had the time or interest. I don‚Äôt want to waste time doing things in 10 ways.That‚Äôs is where ios excels. Also I have both the oneplus 7 and Samsung tabs. Never was the toggling, browsing or general icon animation this smooth like in IOS. The android tabs are the worst , within a few months irrespective of the ram, chipset etc they start lagging, choppy feel to UI .iPad is just a class apart in how the UI is experienced. Does not matter about refresh rates , RAM , snapdragon blah blah. That‚Äôs the best thing about the IPad , you don‚Äôt have to worry about the insides or tech specs other than memory, the thing just works and handles anything you throw at it. That is where the real specialty of the closed garden approach of Apple really helps.You don‚Äôt have a hundred different companies tinkering and doing hundred different software or hardware combos.Last but not the least, the battery is a beast!

Mac M1",N/A,"1. Performance:The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.2. Battery Life:One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.3. Fanless Design:The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.4. Portability:The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.5. Compatibility:The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.6. Rosetta 2:Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.7. Price:The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.8. Integrated Graphics:The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.9. Limited Port Selection:The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.10. Upgradability:The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase."

I love MacBook Air M1!",N/A,"It is an amazing experience to own MacBook Air M1. It is designed for both entertainment and office work.Pros:1. Bright and clear Retina Display that can be turned off if listening to only audio, also display adjusts itself to surrounding light to give clear display.2. Clear stereo effect sound for which you will fall in love.3. Battery life is exceptional, easily you will get more than 10 hours and fast battery charging - takes less than 2 hours to fully charge from less than 10%.4. Touch pad swiping options are excellent that makes your work very productive.5. Very light weight and handy, can hold the laptop in one hand easily and can open the laptop screen in one finger!.6. No lag or hanging even while running any games or apps.7. Smooth key board with backlit keys that changes its light intensity based on the surrounding light.8. No fan noise. Basically there is no fan so how can one get noise from it?9. Strong build quality made of aluminium body.10. Beautiful colour, looks and finish of the laptop body.11. Airdrop, screen sharing, FaceTime Calling, Blue tooth connectivity features are amazing.12. Inbuilt screen recording feature, photo and video editing features are great.Cons:1. Some keys are missing in Keyboard compared to Windows laptop.2. The laptop surface is very slick and the laptop slides on your lap or in your hand, so better to use a cover to avoid sliding.3. Occasionally you may feel some heat from the laptop4. Lack of some ports like USB 3, HDMI, SD Card etc.,I was bit hesitant to buy MacBook initially because of the Operating System and compatibility with other apps/software.  But after I bought it I am loving the Mac OS and got MS office installed on it easily. Also, the deal under 70K in the recent Amazon Big Indian festival was really worth.I am using iPhone from last 15 years and I never wanted to switch over to Android phone any time because I know what is iPhone!. You will know what is iPhone only if you own it and just like that without owning MacBook you will never know what is it and once you own it you will never go back. You will miss the amazing creation of Steve Jobs if you don't own a MacBook!."

If you are a student want it for coding then just go for itBad things1. In base variant It has very less storage and it is also not upgradable after purchase. And if your try to get 1tb storage before purchase it will cost extra 40000 which is very expensive so you needs to buy a external ssd or hdd.2. It has only 2 ports so you also need to buy a connector which will allow you to connect more things3. it's screen catches dust very quickly so you need a anti dust screen gaurd for it"

Excellent performance, great battery",N/A,"I got my product delivered earlier this week. My first impression was that it is thinner than I had anticipated, which is great. Looks sleek, but is very powerful. Though I admit I haven‚Äôt done much expect some streaming, browsing and document creation work, it has worked flawlessly so far, with absolutely no lag. I would say that despite only 8 GB, it would beat any 16GB, Core i5 PC hands down on performance.The display is good though if you have used an FHD LED display, you may notice the difference, especially the black colour. But it is not a major issue.The biggest advantage is the battery. After the first full recharge, I used it for around 14 hours before I charged it again with 24% remaining. This could be the single-largest attribute in its favour. The keyboard looks premium and keys are easy to use.In summary, a great choice even in 2024. I would like to see how it performs on some light programming / compiling activities, but I am sure it will perform well there too. Very happy so far."

However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.9. Limited Port Selection:The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.10. Upgradability:The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase."

I love MacBook Air M1!",N/A,"It is an amazing experience to own MacBook Air M1. It is designed for both entertainment and office work.Pros:1. Bright and clear Retina Display that can be turned off if listening to only audio, also display adjusts itself to surrounding light to give clear display.2. Clear stereo effect sound for which you will fall in love.3. Battery life is exceptional, easily you will get more than 10 hours and fast battery charging - takes less than 2 hours to fully charge from less than 10%.4. Touch pad swiping options are excellent that makes your work very productive.5. Very light weight and handy, can hold the laptop in one hand easily and can open the laptop screen in one finger!.6. No lag or hanging even while running any games or apps.7. Smooth key board with backlit keys that changes its light intensity based on the surrounding light.8. No fan noise. Basically there is no fan so how can one get noise from it?9. Strong build quality made of aluminium body.10. Beautiful colour, looks and finish of the laptop body.11. Airdrop, screen sharing, FaceTime Calling, Blue tooth connectivity features are amazing.12. Inbuilt screen recording feature, photo and video editing features are great.Cons:1. Some keys are missing in Keyboard compared to Windows laptop.2. The laptop surface is very slick and the laptop slides on your lap or in your hand, so better to use a cover to avoid sliding.3. Occasionally you may feel some heat from the laptop4. Lack of some ports like USB 3, HDMI, SD Card etc.,I was bit hesitant to buy MacBook initially because of the Operating System and compatibility with other apps/software.  But after I bought it I am loving the Mac OS and got MS office installed on it easily. Also, the deal under 70K in the recent Amazon Big Indian festival was really worth.I am using iPhone from last 15 years and I never wanted to switch over to Android phone any time because I know what is iPhone!. You will know what is iPhone only if you own it and just like that without owning MacBook you will never know what is it and once you own it you will never go back. You will miss the amazing creation of Steve Jobs if you don't own a MacBook!."

Excellent performance, great battery",N/A,"I got my product delivered earlier this week. My first impression was that it is thinner than I had anticipated, which is great. Looks sleek, but is very powerful. Though I admit I haven‚Äôt done much expect some streaming, browsing and document creation work, it has worked flawlessly so far, with absolutely no lag. I would say that despite only 8 GB, it would beat any 16GB, Core i5 PC hands down on performance.The display is good though if you have used an FHD LED display, you may notice the difference, especially the black colour. But it is not a major issue.The biggest advantage is the battery. After the first full recharge, I used it for around 14 hours before I charged it again with 24% remaining. This could be the single-largest attribute in its favour. The keyboard looks premium and keys are easy to use.In summary, a great choice even in 2024. I would like to see how it performs on some light programming / compiling activities, but I am sure it will perform well there too. Very happy so far."

Mac M1",N/A,"1. Performance:The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.2. Battery Life:One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.3. Fanless Design:The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.4. Portability:The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.5. Compatibility:The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.6. Rosetta 2:Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.7. Price:The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.8. Integrated Graphics:The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing.

This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.4. Portability:The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.5. Compatibility:The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.6. Rosetta 2:Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.7. Price:The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.8. Integrated Graphics:The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.9. Limited Port Selection:The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.10. Upgradability:The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase."

I love MacBook Air M1!",N/A,"It is an amazing experience to own MacBook Air M1. It is designed for both entertainment and office work.Pros:1. Bright and clear Retina Display that can be turned off if listening to only audio, also display adjusts itself to surrounding light to give clear display.2. Clear stereo effect sound for which you will fall in love.3. Battery life is exceptional, easily you will get more than 10 hours and fast battery charging - takes less than 2 hours to fully charge from less than 10%.4. Touch pad swiping options are excellent that makes your work very productive.5. Very light weight and handy, can hold the laptop in one hand easily and can open the laptop screen in one finger!.6. No lag or hanging even while running any games or apps.7. Smooth key board with backlit keys that changes its light intensity based on the surrounding light.8. No fan noise. Basically there is no fan so how can one get noise from it?9. Strong build quality made of aluminium body.10. Beautiful colour, looks and finish of the laptop body.11. Airdrop, screen sharing, FaceTime Calling, Blue tooth connectivity features are amazing.12. Inbuilt screen recording feature, photo and video editing features are great.Cons:1. Some keys are missing in Keyboard compared to Windows laptop.2. The laptop surface is very slick and the laptop slides on your lap or in your hand, so better to use a cover to avoid sliding.3. Occasionally you may feel some heat from the laptop4. Lack of some ports like USB 3, HDMI, SD Card etc.,I was bit hesitant to buy MacBook initially because of the Operating System and compatibility with other apps/software.  But after I bought it I am loving the Mac OS and got MS office installed on it easily. Also, the deal under 70K in the recent Amazon Big Indian festival was really worth.I am using iPhone from last 15 years and I never wanted to switch over to Android phone any time because I know what is iPhone!. You will know what is iPhone only if you own it and just like that without owning MacBook you will never know what is it and once you own it you will never go back. You will miss the amazing creation of Steve Jobs if you don't own a MacBook!."

I am writting the review after using it 2 monthsGood things1. It is very fast2. Its finger sensor it aslo very fast3. It is very light weight4. It is easy to travel with it5. It is unbeatable in performance6. It is fully metal body7. Its metal finish is awesome8. Its look is awesome9. Its 8gb ram works more efficient than 16 gb ram of other laptops10. If you are a student want it for coding then just go for itBad things1. In base variant It has very less storage and it is also not upgradable after purchase. And if your try to get 1tb storage before purchase it will cost extra 40000 which is very expensive so you needs to buy a external ssd or hdd.2. It has only 2 ports so you also need to buy a connector which will allow you to connect more things3. it's screen catches dust very quickly so you need a anti dust screen gaurd for it"

Excellent performance, great battery",N/A,"I got my product delivered earlier this week. My first impression was that it is thinner than I had anticipated, which is great. Looks sleek, but is very powerful. Though I admit I haven‚Äôt done much expect some streaming, browsing and document creation work, it has worked flawlessly so far, with absolutely no lag. I would say that despite only 8 GB, it would beat any 16GB, Core i5 PC hands down on performance.The display is good though if you have used an FHD LED display, you may notice the difference, especially the black colour. But it is not a major issue.The biggest advantage is the battery. After the first full recharge, I used it for around 14 hours before I charged it again with 24% remaining. This could be the single-largest attribute in its favour. The keyboard looks premium and keys are easy to use.In summary, a great choice even in 2024. I would like to see how it performs on some light programming / compiling activities, but I am sure it will perform well there too. Very happy so far."

(remember you are getting Helio G99 which is a mid-range Mobile gaming processor. and at 15k no other brand gives G99. kudos to Redmi.)Display is good though contrast and viewing angles can be better. still better at par with any IPS LCD under 20k price.Speakers have good clarity, loudness, and good sterio output.Charging speed is decent but still not comparable to current smartphone standards.accessories are easily available.No LTE - which is a minus point.Wifi reception is stable and good though.No 3.5mm port which is a real minus point.No active pen support -which is acceptable. No other company gives pen support at 15k anyway.in general - excellent value for money at 15k.Alternatives with same /similar processor - Realme Pad 2 (11.5 inch, G99, WiFi+LTE) at 19k.OnePlus Pad Go (11"", G99, WiFi only) at 20k.Lenovo P11 Gen2 (11.5, G99, Wifi+LTE) at 20k.Lenovo M10 plus at 18-19k."

Great design and good performance with excellent battery backup",N/A,"It‚Äôs a beautiful machine with great design and features along with good performance. For me USP is the backlit keyboard. Overall great purchase. Battery backup is good, I tested for 3 hrs and it was still more than 50 percent. Silent operation, no sound of fan etc. Tested with multitasking, it worked efficiently. Windows 11 with MS office 2021 is available with this . So overall it has been a great purchase. It runs older games of 2000s as well."

GOOD PHONE",N/A,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M32 Prime Edition in Black with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage, and I am more than satisfied with my choice. This smartphone offers a fantastic blend of performance, display quality, and camera capabilities, making it a top-tier choice in its price range.First and foremost, the display is a real standout feature. The 6.4-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen is a joy to look at. Colors are vibrant, and the contrast is excellent, ensuring that everything from streaming videos to browsing the web is visually stunning. The 90Hz refresh rate is a welcome addition, delivering smooth and fluid scrolling and animations.Performance-wise, the device is impressive. The 6GB of RAM, combined with the MediaTek Helio G80 processor, handles multitasking and app switching effortlessly. Whether I'm running multiple apps simultaneously or playing graphics-intensive games, the Galaxy M32 Prime Edition maintains a high level of performance without any noticeable lag.The camera system on this smartphone is also quite remarkable. The 64MP main camera captures sharp and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The 20MP front camera takes clear and vibrant selfies, and the additional lenses, including the 8MP ultra-wide and 5MP macro cameras, offer versatility for different photography needs.The battery life is another strong point of the M32 Prime Edition. The 6000mAh battery ensures that the phone easily lasts all day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. Fast charging support means you can quickly top up your battery when needed.The One UI 3.1 interface on top of Android 11 provides a user-friendly and customizable experience. It offers features like Samsung Knox security and a secure folder for added privacy.Connectivity options are comprehensive with dual SIM support, 4G compatibility, and a dedicated microSD card slot for expanding storage if needed.One minor drawback might be the phone's design, which is a bit on the bulky side. However, this is a matter of personal preference and does not detract significantly from the overall experience.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy M32 Prime Edition is an excellent mid-range smartphone that offers a remarkable display, strong performance, capable cameras, and outstanding battery life. It strikes a balance between affordability and functionality, making it a solid choice for anyone looking for a feature-rich phone without breaking the bank. Whether you're a content consumer, a multitasker, or a photography enthusiast, the M32 Prime Edition is sure to impress."

Good mobile for basic decent use",N/A,"First thing I liked about this phone is its size.. it's handy at 6.4"". Got it in independence day sale for rs.12500, good deal. Display is good as use to be in all Samsung mobiles. Camera is good in good lighting conditions...else average. Battery backup is good. With decent use it comes for 1.5days. I have loaded my office teams outlook and other office apps. It works like a charm.. only thing I don't like is the quality of speaker. Earlier I used redmi's note 4 and note 10 which had superb dual speakers. Loved them for that reason but they were poor at reliability.. so settled with this m32 and I am happy for that..."

Vertical green Harmful lines found. Very difficult to look at it even for 5 min.",N/A,"From the beginning this smart phone has full of defects. In the picture you can clearly see that there are several green vertical lines.This vertical Harmful green lines tor eyes are increasing day by day. The most disgraceful part is that I mailed them a number of times, but didn't do any kind of impactful assistance. They are not even providing their contact numbers so that I can put complains against them. Nowadays this types of defects are very common in Samsung smart phone. Because one of my colleagues has been suffering from the same problems. But the only difference is that in his phone there are pink lines instead of green lines"

GOOD PHONE",N/A,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M32 Prime Edition in Black with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage, and I am more than satisfied with my choice. This smartphone offers a fantastic blend of performance, display quality, and camera capabilities, making it a top-tier choice in its price range.First and foremost, the display is a real standout feature. The 6.4-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen is a joy to look at. Colors are vibrant, and the contrast is excellent, ensuring that everything from streaming videos to browsing the web is visually stunning. The 90Hz refresh rate is a welcome addition, delivering smooth and fluid scrolling and animations.Performance-wise, the device is impressive. The 6GB of RAM, combined with the MediaTek Helio G80 processor, handles multitasking and app switching effortlessly. Whether I'm running multiple apps simultaneously or playing graphics-intensive games, the Galaxy M32 Prime Edition maintains a high level of performance without any noticeable lag.The camera system on this smartphone is also quite remarkable. The 64MP main camera captures sharp and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The 20MP front camera takes clear and vibrant selfies, and the additional lenses, including the 8MP ultra-wide and 5MP macro cameras, offer versatility for different photography needs.The battery life is another strong point of the M32 Prime Edition. The 6000mAh battery ensures that the phone easily lasts all day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. Fast charging support means you can quickly top up your battery when needed.The One UI 3.1 interface on top of Android 11 provides a user-friendly and customizable experience. It offers features like Samsung Knox security and a secure folder for added privacy.Connectivity options are comprehensive with dual SIM support, 4G compatibility, and a dedicated microSD card slot for expanding storage if needed.One minor drawback might be the phone's design, which is a bit on the bulky side. However, this is a matter of personal preference and does not detract significantly from the overall experience.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy M32 Prime Edition is an excellent mid-range smartphone that offers a remarkable display, strong performance, capable cameras, and outstanding battery life. It strikes a balance between affordability and functionality, making it a solid choice for anyone looking for a feature-rich phone without breaking the bank. Whether you're a content consumer, a multitasker, or a photography enthusiast, the M32 Prime Edition is sure to impress."

It becomes quite loud at full volumeMetallic finish, though it's mostly plastic.File transfers are fairly fast when connected to a PCAndroid 12 out of the box, which is just 1 generation old as of 2023Can play 4K videos tooUSB type C supportCons:Below average cameras (Rear is 5MP with 1080p/30FPS recording, front is 2MP with only 720p/30FPS recording)Charges at 10 watts only, so takes a long time to charge the 5100mAH batteryA bit on the heavier side at 460 grams.No charger included in the boxNo 3.5mm jackI don't know about the gaming performance as I don't play games. But as far as I know, the Helio G80 processor (though over 3 years old in 2023) in this can handle casual gaming & gaming at lower settings.What I can definitely say is that this is a perfect tablet for watching movies, listening to music, taking online classes, working on documents, video calls etc."

Cheap and okay tablet for basic media consumption and book reading",N/A,"This tablet is just okay in all aspects, nothing too spectacular about it but nothing is bad either, and it is cheap enough ( I got it for 9500 Rupees). It just simply delivers what you can expect from an Android tablet at this low price.. You can use it for watching stuff on streaming services at Full HD resolution , netflix prime video hotstar etc all work satisfactorily on this device. And its also okay for reading books/manga thanks to the big and crisp IPS screen.Pros-1. 10 inch IPS Full HD screen2. Okay battery life (lasts for about a day)3. Surprisingly decent stereo speakers4. Comes with Android 12 and mostly bloat-free experience, there are a few useless pre-installed apps but you can uninstall/disable all of it pretty easily5. All Google apps ecosystem are also available on thisCons-1. no headphone jack so you need to use bluetooth earphones2. brightness a bit lacking if you use it in bright area and the screen is also susceptible to glare3. charging is kinda slow4. RAM is a bit low at just 3GB so if you multi-task the apps in background usually gets cleared out from memoryOverall I suppose it is fine for an absolutely cheap entry level tablet , cant really expect much more at this price. I would have liked a headphone jack though.."

Cheap and okay tablet for basic media consumption and book reading",N/A,"This tablet is just okay in all aspects, nothing too spectacular about it but nothing is bad either, and it is cheap enough ( I got it for 9500 Rupees). It just simply delivers what you can expect from an Android tablet at this low price.. You can use it for watching stuff on streaming services at Full HD resolution , netflix prime video hotstar etc all work satisfactorily on this device. And its also okay for reading books/manga thanks to the big and crisp IPS screen.Pros-1. 10 inch IPS Full HD screen2. Okay battery life (lasts for about a day)3. Surprisingly decent stereo speakers4. Comes with Android 12 and mostly bloat-free experience, there are a few useless pre-installed apps but you can uninstall/disable all of it pretty easily5.

The best tablet under 10K",N/A,"Hello all,I recently purchased the Honor Pad X8 at an effective price of 9.9K. And at this price this is unbeatable! Please note that no charger is included in the box - only the USB cable.Below are the pros & cons:Pros:Crisp 10.1 inch FHD LCD display (60Hz only though - can't expect 120Hz under 10K)Good sound quality, with good enough base. It becomes quite loud at full volumeMetallic finish, though it's mostly plastic.File transfers are fairly fast when connected to a PCAndroid 12 out of the box, which is just 1 generation old as of 2023Can play 4K videos tooUSB type C supportCons:Below average cameras (Rear is 5MP with 1080p/30FPS recording, front is 2MP with only 720p/30FPS recording)Charges at 10 watts only, so takes a long time to charge the 5100mAH batteryA bit on the heavier side at 460 grams.No charger included in the boxNo 3.5mm jackI don't know about the gaming performance as I don't play games. But as far as I know, the Helio G80 processor (though over 3 years old in 2023) in this can handle casual gaming & gaming at lower settings.What I can definitely say is that this is a perfect tablet for watching movies, listening to music, taking online classes, working on documents, video calls etc."

Fast, excellent battery life, fully packed. Redefines what a Budget Laptop can be! Definite Buy!",N/A,"REDEFINES BUDGET LAPTOPSReview Date: May 24, 2022VERDICT: DEFINITE BUY.SUMMARY: Score: 9.0/10.Back with HP after 14 years and loving it!This is an excellent laptop that redefines what budget laptops offer. Looks, features, performance and battery life- all at a different level. Rivals laptops that retailed at 50k just a few months back. This is only the 3rd time in 20 years that something has felt like a REAL upgrade in technology (first was Ahtlon 64, next was affordable SSDs, and now this).Additionally, nowadays, you get Windows and Office free for the device‚Äôs life. Solid hardware specs and useful software pre-loaded means a complete laptop that does not need any user expertise in upgrading.USAGE: 3 daysPROCESSES FOLLOWED: 3 full battery cycles, debloating (McAfee, LastPass, some MS games), some power management tweaksREVIEW:Key Laptop components reviewed below with Pros and Cons of each.ÔÉò CASE AND BUILD: 9/10Full plastic. Compact but chunky. Lid is plain. Keyboard panel is brushed finish. Bottom is matte plastic.PROS: Looks good. Compact but chunky. Comfortable to hold.CONS: Plain lid attracts dust and fingerprints.ÔÉò LID: 9/10Black matte finish on the inside. Hinge is firm. No wobble. Opens to approx. 115 deg.PROS: Seems reliable enough.CONS: Single hinge design forces keyboard down, reducing area available for trackpad.ÔÉò KEYBOARD: 9/10Backlit (2 levels). Separate paging keys. Lights for Caps Lock and Audio Off (no idea why).PROS: Keys slightly scalloped, offering good hold. Separate paging keys are a life saver when working in Excel. Two Stage backlight. Tactile (but little mushy). Give it 1-2 days to break in.CONS: Slightly noisy when typing fast. No dedicated function keys for Mic Off/ Sleep. Power button is recessed, causing some misses when pressing.ÔÉò TRACKPAD: 7/10Area seems 16+:9 (like current smartphones). Slightly rough texture. Slight rattle when tapping. But way more reliable and smooth than Asus‚Äô touchpads.PROs: Smooth and accurate tracking.CONs: Tapping is very uncomfortable (due to the clattering noise)- so dragging may not be comfortable.ÔÉò SCREEN: 9/10Glossy screen. Gives sharp text and good contrast. Can use 14‚Äù at 100% scaling (or for older guys) 115%.PROs: Bright. Excellent contrast. Text is sharp and readable.CONs: Contrast and colour balance drop off below 80% brightness.ÔÉò PORTS: 8/101 SD Card reader (full size), 1x HDMI, 2xUSB3-A, 1xUSB-C, 1x3.5mm.PROs: Strong suite of ports.CONs: All (except SD Card) are on the right side. Using a mouse is a pain.ÔÉò UPGRADABILITY: 9/10PROs: 2 separate RAM slots (have not opened, checked from reviews).CONs: At least 4 screws are located under the 2 rubber pads. Not user upgradeable.ÔÉò SOFTWARE: 10/10Windows 11 Home. System Encryption is available. Office H&S 2021 for life. A few bloatware- McAfee, LastPass and some Windows games. Easy to uninstall.ÔÉò PERFORMANCE: 10/10The Ryzen 3 5300U is freakishly fast! Cannot believe this level of performance at ‚Çπ40k. Launching apps, multi-tasking, etc.- all effortless.PROs: Super-powerful CPU. Stays cool. Also easy to control turbo in Windows 11 (unlike Ryzen 3 3250U)- setting Max CPU level at 99% limits speed to 2.6GHz. Under normal usage (setting up laptop, indexing, etc.) in peak Delhi summer in non-AC room, CPU temp was 45-55 deg C (Asus‚Äô Ryzen 3 3250 model runs at 80+ deg C). Keyboard stays cool.CONs: Fan response seems slow. Stays quiet for some time, suddenly ramps up to a single speed for some minutes and slows down again. Small distraction.ÔÉò BATTERY: 10/10Battery is rated at 41.050Wh. Max was at 41.005Wh. Battery is the older higher voltage kind (11-13V), compared to the newer 8V ones. But my experience with older batteries has been much better. The newer ones dropped off faster after about 3 years. And usage of the same components would help HP keep costs in check. So no complaints.PROs: Excellent battery life. With some basic tweaks, power usage in normal situations is between 3-5W, giving a battery backup of 8Hrs-10+Hrs. I don‚Äôt think you can ask for anything more. Compare this with Asus‚Äô Ryzen 3 3250U model where I had to do N things to get heat and battery backup to acceptable levels. I did not have to do anything special here.CONs: Imagine what would happen if HP gave a 56Whr battery- who needs a MacBook?COMPARED TO ASUS:Asus has been the leader in laptop innovations- bringing in Full HD and dual storage to budget laptops. I have 2 Asus systems. But of late they have started skimping in important areas-ÔÉò Semi-passive cooling leads to higher temperatures and frequent throttling of CPUs even in normal usages. Keyboards become uncomfortably hot.ÔÉò Screens are matte (useful), but have very low contrast (text is harder to read when documents are zoomed out).ÔÉò HDD installation kits are cheap and flimsy. I‚Äôve seen in 2 cases where the cheap cable causes data transfer errors and Windows crashes as well (for the record, I have Windows 10/11 in 4 PCs from 1st Gen Intel to 7th Gen- and there was not a single crash in any of them).When I bought a new Asus Vivobook a few months back, it was a big disappointment. I felt like I was back in the Windows XP days when I used to spend hours trying to get things to work. This HP has been a very good experience. Fully specced, well configured and works as it should."

Complete Waste of money ; Worst Laptop I have ever used in my life",N/A,"pathetic build quality ; the trackpad's ""polish"" got scratched somehow, and now it very uneven and such a terrible experience to use the trackpad. Also, a part of the screen got kind of damaged somehow, such it is a bit greyish in that region (probably a hardware problem) . Also, the lid is kind of tilted from the left end already, like within a year of usage. Absolutely terrible build quality.Terrible performance as well. I used to get blue screen of death error atleast twice a day, until i got the ssd changed, that too which I had to get installed via 3rd party. Hp customer support and service center is also completely trash. They didn't get the ssd changed until the device was in warranty period ; they once got the ram changed (they told so, i don't even believe they did anything at all) in the warranty period, but it was of no use.Moreover, when the delivery package arrived, the box was a bit damaged, due to which i wasn't able to get the complete serial number, so i wasn't able to extend the warranty.Such a waste of time of money. Never buying HP products again"

Looks, features, performance and battery life- all at a different level. Rivals laptops that retailed at 50k just a few months back. This is only the 3rd time in 20 years that something has felt like a REAL upgrade in technology (first was Ahtlon 64, next was affordable SSDs, and now this).Additionally, nowadays, you get Windows and Office free for the device‚Äôs life. Solid hardware specs and useful software pre-loaded means a complete laptop that does not need any user expertise in upgrading.USAGE: 3 daysPROCESSES FOLLOWED: 3 full battery cycles, debloating (McAfee, LastPass, some MS games), some power management tweaksREVIEW:Key Laptop components reviewed below with Pros and Cons of each.ÔÉò CASE AND BUILD: 9/10Full plastic. Compact but chunky. Lid is plain. Keyboard panel is brushed finish. Bottom is matte plastic.PROS: Looks good. Compact but chunky. Comfortable to hold.CONS: Plain lid attracts dust and fingerprints.ÔÉò LID: 9/10Black matte finish on the inside. Hinge is firm. No wobble. Opens to approx. 115 deg.PROS: Seems reliable enough.CONS: Single hinge design forces keyboard down, reducing area available for trackpad.ÔÉò KEYBOARD: 9/10Backlit (2 levels). Separate paging keys. Lights for Caps Lock and Audio Off (no idea why).PROS: Keys slightly scalloped, offering good hold. Separate paging keys are a life saver when working in Excel. Two Stage backlight. Tactile (but little mushy). Give it 1-2 days to break in.CONS: Slightly noisy when typing fast. No dedicated function keys for Mic Off/ Sleep. Power button is recessed, causing some misses when pressing.ÔÉò TRACKPAD: 7/10Area seems 16+:9 (like current smartphones). Slightly rough texture. Slight rattle when tapping. But way more reliable and smooth than Asus‚Äô touchpads.PROs: Smooth and accurate tracking.CONs: Tapping is very uncomfortable (due to the clattering noise)- so dragging may not be comfortable.ÔÉò SCREEN: 9/10Glossy screen. Gives sharp text and good contrast. Can use 14‚Äù at 100% scaling (or for older guys) 115%.PROs: Bright. Excellent contrast. Text is sharp and readable.CONs: Contrast and colour balance drop off below 80% brightness.ÔÉò PORTS: 8/101 SD Card reader (full size), 1x HDMI, 2xUSB3-A, 1xUSB-C, 1x3.5mm.PROs: Strong suite of ports.CONs: All (except SD Card) are on the right side. Using a mouse is a pain.ÔÉò UPGRADABILITY: 9/10PROs: 2 separate RAM slots (have not opened, checked from reviews).CONs: At least 4 screws are located under the 2 rubber pads. Not user upgradeable.ÔÉò SOFTWARE: 10/10Windows 11 Home. System Encryption is available. Office H&S 2021 for life. A few bloatware- McAfee, LastPass and some Windows games. Easy to uninstall.ÔÉò PERFORMANCE: 10/10The Ryzen 3 5300U is freakishly fast! Cannot believe this level of performance at ‚Çπ40k. Launching apps, multi-tasking, etc.- all effortless.PROs: Super-powerful CPU. Stays cool. Also easy to control turbo in Windows 11 (unlike Ryzen 3 3250U)- setting Max CPU level at 99% limits speed to 2.6GHz. Under normal usage (setting up laptop, indexing, etc.) in peak Delhi summer in non-AC room, CPU temp was 45-55 deg C (Asus‚Äô Ryzen 3 3250 model runs at 80+ deg C). Keyboard stays cool.CONs: Fan response seems slow. Stays quiet for some time, suddenly ramps up to a single speed for some minutes and slows down again. Small distraction.ÔÉò BATTERY: 10/10Battery is rated at 41.050Wh. Max was at 41.005Wh. Battery is the older higher voltage kind (11-13V), compared to the newer 8V ones.

Complete Waste of money ; Worst Laptop I have ever used in my life",N/A,"pathetic build quality ; the trackpad's ""polish"" got scratched somehow, and now it very uneven and such a terrible experience to use the trackpad. Also, a part of the screen got kind of damaged somehow, such it is a bit greyish in that region (probably a hardware problem) . Also, the lid is kind of tilted from the left end already, like within a year of usage. Absolutely terrible build quality.Terrible performance as well. I used to get blue screen of death error atleast twice a day, until i got the ssd changed, that too which I had to get installed via 3rd party. Hp customer support and service center is also completely trash. They didn't get the ssd changed until the device was in warranty period ; they once got the ram changed (they told so, i don't even believe they did anything at all) in the warranty period, but it was of no use.Moreover, when the delivery package arrived, the box was a bit damaged, due to which i wasn't able to get the complete serial number, so i wasn't able to extend the warranty.Such a waste of time of money.

Worth to buy",N/A,"I bought this laptop on summer sale. Here is the review after 2-3 weeks of usage.Pros:1. Budget - Bought this laptop for 32K after discounts.2. Processor - Ryzen 3 with 4 cores with 16GB of RAM.3. MS office with lifetime validity.4. Screen quality is excellent.5. Light weight - Weights around 1.5 KG, which is very easy to carry for daily use.6. Battery backup - On an average battery with stands for 6 to 8 hours after full charge (Continuously browsing, doing office work).7. Screen size - 14 inch which is easy to carry.8. Boot time - Takes around 8 to 10 seconds to reach login screen (Win 11 is pre-installed)9. Track pad is precise and responsive.10. Keys are large enough to hold & press. This laptop comes with backlit support, which is quite impressive.11. Speaker sound is above average.12. Camera quality is average but enough to attend meetings.Cons:1. Battery indicator is placed next to the charging port, sometimes it is quite difficult to find the laptop is charged or still charging.2. Build quality is average, sometimes I feel like keys not aligned properly.3. Warranty registration - Experienced difficulties to register for warranty with HP site.  HP Support website is not designed intuitively or not self-explanatory.This laptop is ideal for college students and daily use. Don't expect this laptop to run heavy software's and Games."

My Laptop had issues, but this laptop is worth every money",N/A,"This is a great laptop and best in the price bracket. under 40K you get 8Gb of 3200Mhz DDR4 ram with 512 SSD and windows 11 pre installed with office 2019 license. Screen is decent, not the best, not the worst.the only way you get to know it's not built well, when you type on the keyboard. there is a lot of flex to the keyboard and as I am power user, I find it little disappointing. I bought this laptop for my father and he was happy with it. Battery life if good and laptop doesn't heat much.coming to my issue : - My system had an issue with motherboard that battery used to get drained while it was turned off or in hibernation. I was losing 45% per 12hours of system being shutdown.this came to my notice after 7 days of purchase, else would have done the exchange with amazon.had to deal with HP customer support and it was a very horrendous experience. Their Customer support is pathetic but finally after tweeting continuously to their CEO on twitter, they listened to my issue and got me  a refund from HP.ALL in all this is great Laptop, but alas my unit had issues.please ensure your vendor is in the approved HP list before buying it from amazon/ e-commerce websites to ensure maximum HP warranty support."

Doesn't feel like a flagship",N/A,"First of all the violet with titanium sides looks really ugly. Looks like someone added a cheap cover to the phone. The phone is boxy and screen real estate feels low. The camera holes and placement looks cheap. Samsung's fast charging doesn't even come close to One Plus. And the Samsung UI is terrible. Contrary to what you may hear from youtube personalities, this phone is actually pretty below average."

Sold my car to buy this",N/A,"What an amazing product.After seeing the glowing reviews, I had to go and experience this god send product in the Samsung store myself.After playing with it in the store, taking pics of other phones and strangers in the store, I fell in love.I sold my car the next day to get money for this as it was more viable over selling kidney or other organs. I also sold my only double bed, table and old phone to get the 512gb version because who needs SD cards.After buying it with cash (since I don't like taking loans) I was truly blown away. I now Uber everywhere or walk and take pictures on the way. Sometimes some may say that I look like a creep with the amazing zoom but who cares. I paid for it.This is trully the best phone on the market hands down. I am planning to sell my house and potentially the first born for future upgrades of this esteemed phone."

Like that 10 people in one conversation tried their best kill time and tested my patience..Still they it takes 2 or days to resolve and that too no update will be given..i have to call them again and again..Finally, worst product and horrible customer service..I suggest keep yourself from this product and especially Amazon"

Promising Potential But need improvement.",N/A,"Having spent time with the realme Pad Mini WiFi Tablet, I'd like to share my impressions on this device. While it certainly has its strengths, there are a couple of areas that I believe could benefit from improvement.Pros:Cinematic Display: The 22.1cm (8.7 inch) Cinematic Display on the realme Pad Mini is a visual treat. Its vibrant colors and sharp resolution make it well-suited for entertainment and multimedia consumption.Battery Capacity: The 6400 mAh battery is a definite highlight, providing a commendable amount of power for extended usage. I appreciated not having to constantly worry about recharging during my tasks and entertainment sessions.Dual Speakers: The presence of dual speakers enhances the audio experience, making movie watching and music playback more enjoyable.Cons:Speed and Performance: While the tablet offers solid performance for everyday tasks, I found that it struggled with more demanding applications and multitasking scenarios. There were instances of lag and slower response times, which could be improved for a smoother user experience.ROM (Storage): While the 64GB ROM (Expandable) is a decent starting point, it may fall short for users with larger storage needs. The option to store more apps, media, and files without constantly managing storage space would be beneficial."

Does not meet expectation",N/A,I ordered this product after seeing so many positive comments that it is good in noise cancellation.However it is not the case with me.1. NC is working fine when we use this with smartphone2. NC literally doesn't work with online calling like for Genesys App.3. If you're in Zoom call with this and if you have Noice Cancellation enabled in Zoom itself then your legitimate speech will be truncated ! This headphone works well with Zoom calls/meetings if NC is disabled under Zoom settings.4. Buds are so thin and hence you will feel plastic on your ears and it is painful.Suggestion to manufacturer if they see this:Take some more money but make it comfortable and NC should work with every app instead of only with Zoom and smartphones.Thank you!

One of the best in category especially for beginners",N/A,"So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone"

Improvement requires",N/A,"Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""HOW MUCH TIME I WASTE PLEASE DO NOT NEED TO ANYBODY ELSE BE CAREFUL"

Value for money",N/A,"It's value for money. CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor."

Good laptop with perfomance, could have been better.",N/A,"Excellent value for money purchase with a powerful chipset, decent battery life, good display for a regular use. Good keyboard and trackpad. All the latest wireless conectivity features are included. Good for casual gaming too. But where it falls short is in the sound department, that to falls short by a lightyear. Speakers are absolutely pathetic with no loudnes no bass no nothing. But i dont use the laptop speakers much for anything. So not much of an issue for me. Buit quality is satisfactory. If you are on a budget and want a powerful laptop with some compromises, go for it without thinking much. If you can strech your budget a little bit more, you can easily find much better options from well reputed brands."

Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.3. It's a lightweight laptop.4. Impressive overall performance.Cons:1. The build quality is primarily plastic.2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.3. Lack of a Type-C charger.4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished."

However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop.

Value for money",N/A,"It's value for money. CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor."

Good laptop with perfomance, could have been better.",N/A,"Excellent value for money purchase with a powerful chipset, decent battery life, good display for a regular use. Good keyboard and trackpad. All the latest wireless conectivity features are included. Good for casual gaming too. But where it falls short is in the sound department, that to falls short by a lightyear. Speakers are absolutely pathetic with no loudnes no bass no nothing. But i dont use the laptop speakers much for anything. So not much of an issue for me. Buit quality is satisfactory. If you are on a budget and want a powerful laptop with some compromises, go for it without thinking much. If you can strech your budget a little bit more, you can easily find much better options from well reputed brands."

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone"

I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.Booting speed is good.

Value for money",N/A,"It's value for money. CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor."

Good laptop with perfomance, could have been better.",N/A,"Excellent value for money purchase with a powerful chipset, decent battery life, good display for a regular use. Good keyboard and trackpad. All the latest wireless conectivity features are included. Good for casual gaming too. But where it falls short is in the sound department, that to falls short by a lightyear. Speakers are absolutely pathetic with no loudnes no bass no nothing. But i dont use the laptop speakers much for anything. So not much of an issue for me. Buit quality is satisfactory. If you are on a budget and want a powerful laptop with some compromises, go for it without thinking much. If you can strech your budget a little bit more, you can easily find much better options from well reputed brands."

One of the best in category especially for beginners",N/A,"So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone"

Great value for Money! Best in its class!!",N/A,"BUYED 8GB RAM, 256GB ROM -After using this Tablet for 50 days, I wanted to share my experience. I was cautious due to some reviews mentioning issues after a few days of usage. However, I can confidently say that the Tablet has exceeded my expectations.Powered by the 870 Snapdragon, the performance is exceptional, whether it's gaming, watching videos, or multitasking. The speed has never been a challenge. Despite concerns about the processor being labeled as old in some YouTube reviews, I believe for typical tablet usage‚Äîchecking emails, watching videos, gaming, or even used for designing and sketching‚Äîthe 870 Snapdragon handles it superbly.The only thing which I have struggled to do is to drag an image from one app (Google Chrome Images) to the another app (WhatsApp).The Dolby Atmos feature enhances the audio quality, providing a delightful experience on media apps like YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, or Spotify (can be availed from the options for all media apps). The speakers on either side deliver tremendous sound quality, and also help create a seamless and smooth (gitterless) video experience.The camera performs well for video calls and capturing document images in good lighting. Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, without any lag.It's important to note that chasing after the latest specifications, such as an upgraded processor and higher camera pixels, often comes with a higher price tag. Brands that promise extensive specifications at a certain price point may not deliver as they claim.In this regard, I believe this Tablet offers great value without compromising on performance. Cheers!!"

AWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!",N/A,"This is my first tablet (8GB AND 256GB VARIANT) and i have bought this after researching a lot in youtube. I have purchased all the three items(PAD,(KEYBOARDand PEN bought from mi site)). I felt so happy with the keyboard.It made me feel like a compact laptop.Now let me share the review in detail.1)DISPLAY:It comes with ips lcd panel,where the colours are true and picture quality is so crisp and clear.It supports 4k content in youtube,but OTT apps like disney,amazon,etc support only 1080p not 4k.However the picture quality is good.Watching 4k content in youtube gives an immense satisfaction.brightness of the display is great.In one word the DISPLAY is STUNNING.2)SOUND:This element is the best in this tab.The DOLBY ATMOS in the tab is marvelous.While watching OTT or youtube content which support ATMOS,you will experience a theatric feel.Xiaomi has nailed in this sound segment.In word the SOUND is AMAZING.3)PROCESSOR:Even though sd 870 is an older processor it is still as promising as it was at its launch.Day to day tasks run so smoothly.The ram managent is so efficient.I played games like asphalt 9 legends and Call of duty at maximum settings and the processor handled smoothly without any lag.Surprisingly even after palying COD for 1 hour I didn't notice any heating issue.In word the PROCESSOR is PROMISING.4)BATTERY:It takes around 2 hours for fully charging this 8840mah tablet.The tablet comes with 33W fast charger.We get 2 days of battery life for normal day to day tasks.But if you do a lot of gaming it lasts less than a day.In one word the BATTERY is SUFFICIENT.5)DESIGN:The tablet comes with a metal body and gives a premium feel and eventhough the tablet is aroung half  a KG,you will not notice it.The weight distribution is so good.In one word the DESIGN is PREMIUM.I Recommend to buy this tablet and you will not regret even 1%.In this price segment no tablet comes near and you can go for it without any doubt.When you buy a tablet,my suggestion is also buy the keyboard(You may compromise for pen).The combo of tab and keyboard gives the completeness.You will have a wonderful Browsing experinece with keyboard.In one word THIS XIAOMI PAD 6 is TERRIFIC......."

The best tablet under 30K",N/A,"Been using this tablet for over 6 months now, so I feel like I've adequate experience with it to share a long-term review point by point.Pros:1. Display: The display is a beauty it may not be AMOLED (can't expect at this price) but this IPS display is better than every tablet at this price point. It supports HDR and the content played on it looks marvelous (when it plays properly).2 Performance: The Snapdragon 870 is an old flagship processor but it still performs great for media consumption, it easily decodes different video formats without an issue, I've tested 4K 10bit HEVC files and they work fine and it is also good enough for mid-level gaming. Combined with a 144hz refresh rate the whole experience is just smooth. You might feel some lag only if you open multiple resource-heavy windows side by side.3. Battery and Charging: While traveling when I use it for 4-5 hrs a day, it easily lasts for 2.5 days. The default 33W charger goes from 0 to 100 in 90-100 minutes, this speed is acceptable.4. Speakers: They're decent and loud enough to watch videos in a home environment.5. Camera: It is a tablet so don't expect much but the front cam works well for video calls and the single rear camera takes good photos if given enough light, also it supports 4K 30fps recording. But again do not compare the cameras to phone cameras in the same range.6. USB port and storage: It comes with UFS 3.1 and USB Type-C 3.2, both very fast and useful. The USB port supports 5gbps data transfer and video out feature. Many phones in this range don't come with USB 3.2, hats off to Xiaomi for bringing it in this budget.7. Software: The software is clean and fast, also Xiaomi just updated the device to the new Hyper OS based on Android 14, so the updates scene seems sorted as well.And now Cons:1. Software: See, the overall software experience is great, everything works smoothly and there is no crappy bloatware, BUT there is a major bug in the software which irritates the hell out of me: The Widevine L1 certificate gest disabled most of the time, and because of that Netflix and Prime video stop working in HD, few workarounds and restarts later everything gets back to normal but then again in few days same thing repeats, so to run Netflix and Prime in HD I have to go through this tedious process and waste 5-10 minutes. This bug has been a part of Xiaomi OS since Pad 5, still, Xiaomi has done nothing to fix it for good.2. Accessories: The keyboard cover and stylus offered by Xiaomi are too expensive for the price of the tablet, and the third-party pencils available in the market are meh. Xiaomi should have offered the accessories at a discounted price for the customers.3. Missing 3.5 mm jack and fingerprint sensor: There's enough real estate to put a 3.5 mm jack but Xiaomi chose to be Apple. Also, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor would have been great as the face unlock works well in a lit environment but at night it is useless.4. No 5G option: There's no 5G option available for the tablet, wish Xiomi offered on variant with 5G.5. Extended warranty: There's no extended warranty plan from Xiaomi for this tablet, which is disappointing.Except for the Widevine licensing bug, everything else works in the favour of the tab, and I will happily recommend it to everyone."

I got it at @‚Çπ23k flat in Amazon Great Indian Festival. I'm using it for some day let's talk about Pros and Cons till now. üëáüèªProsüëáüèªüëâüèªBuild quality is sturdy and full body is made up of aluminium.üëâüèª Display quality is best with 2.8k 144Hz LCD panle with Dolby Vision. You can easily play 2160p 60fps hdr video on it without any lag or frame skip.üëâüèª Speakers are really awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è. Packed with quad speaker with Dolby Atmos. A full package for multimedia consumption.üëâüèª Performance just leave it üòÖ. It comes with SD870 a most stable processor. If you want to do heavy task or want to play games casual or hardcore no problem you can able to play games at max setting without any lags.üëâüèªIt comes with LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 Storage. My varients is 8Gb/256Gb. There's no lag on app closing/ opening. RAM management is good üòä. Turn Off RAM plus option if don't want lags because it slows down Read/Write speed of secondary memory.üëâüèª Camera's are good for Video Calling or taking pictures of notes that's what you want from a tab.üëâüèªYou can get USB 3.2. You'll get fast transfer speed, Power Delivery support and display output of max 4k@60fps. No one give at this price range.ConsüëáüèªüëâüèªIt comes with 8840mAh battery but due to 2.8k 144Hz display it seems low. But it Depends on you what you are doing. Mine battery didn't last for a day in heavy use.üëâüèªNo headphones jack it's subjective but it's necessary for a tab students use wire headphones during lectures or for gamers also.üëâüèªNo SD Card slot. If you store more lectures and data then it's a issue but you have 2 options 128Gb/256Gb options Choose wisely.üëâüèªSome apps are not optimised for tab it's a big issue sometimes for me.Some apps not working when i install it but after try again and again and then reinstall working well.üëâüèªNo fingerprint sensor it's irritating for me sometimes when I'm using in darküòê. I have switched on bulb or input a long password it really painful üòñ.ConclusionüëáüèªIt's a overall Champian at this price you can everything you want. Buy it and use it without any problems. Overall Performance, Display, Speakers, etc are fabulous üòç. If your budget is under 30k go for it."

Review after 25 days major differences between ios and andriod tab. who should buy or not. read full",N/A,"I bought 8/256 in BB Sale. i was using ipad air gen 2 and confused between mi pad 6, ipad 9th gen and s6 lite. i drooped s6 lite because of screen refresh rate and slow charging , processor etc. i am an andriod user and have window laptop so i chose andriod tablet over ios. because i do not want to pay more for application and i like customization. I thought mi pad 6 is far better then ipad 9th gen. My rating to tablet. Display:- 4.5/5 you get good bigger brighter display. Also have to choose color correction style as per requirement in video tool box which really helpful. Sound:- 3.5/5 Sound are really loud with quad speaker but  clarity of instrument is not good. sometimes you feel background instrument sound compressed. Battery :- 4.5/5 on daily uses to gaming and movie its enough good and fast charge with 33w charger. Its take to full 0 to 100 charge around 90 minutes. Performance :- 4/5 SD 870 is quite good in handling multiple task, split screen and gaming performance is really good. MIUI 4/5 :- I am a MIUI user my first expression with tablet interface was disappointed because it is same as you using a big screen Xiaomi phone. I was expecting more stable and different  interface for tablet as they mentioned that it's different MIUI Tablet OS. Camera:- 3.5/4 not expecting much with tablet camera but just ok camera for document scanning and conference call with always be in Centre conference tool. The last and big difference why ipad still better because of Application Optimization, Many apps not work in landscape mode and no one talked about that in youtube review or nowhere. App like Linkdln, Instagram, News paper apps, and many other student apps not work in landscape mode. many games and application are not smooth as ipad. Its looks like you are using phone application on big screen device sometime pixel density not meet the screen requirements. For Movies and gaming it's a really good device but just for study purpose or drawings go for ipad. because andriod still don't have good apps like ios. i bought stylus also. stylus working smoothly fine but nib lifespan is low.thanks"

Most value for money tablet",N/A,"I wanted a tablet for organizing, reading and creating notes and it has not disappointed so far. Only cons i could find was the non availability of third party alternatives to xiaomi smart pencil 2nd gen(palm rejection and all other enhanced stylus features work exclusively with xiaomi pencil) which comes with a heavy price tag of 6k itself, the spare tip is also not available in Indian market, which can make xiaomi loose its customer to competitive brands like apple.

Overall very good :)",N/A,"Just got my pad yesterday and from first impression view it's very much worth it, the speakers are really good especially if you listen to music encoded in dolby (eg: apple music or tidal).The screen is decent :) maybe we will get a amoled next time :PSince the screen is little different [2.8k display] many apps will not use the full screen properly which is well little sad but i guess it depends on how xiaomi optimises their apps.Netflix though coevered full screen well and i guess perfect as a mutimedia app for this tablet unlike amazon prime or disney plus{keeps playing in 1080p sdr not HDR which is stupid idk why}.Anyways i go enjoy my tab more now xd!!

Great value for Money! Best in its class!!",N/A,"BUYED 8GB RAM, 256GB ROM -After using this Tablet for 50 days, I wanted to share my experience. I was cautious due to some reviews mentioning issues after a few days of usage. However, I can confidently say that the Tablet has exceeded my expectations.Powered by the 870 Snapdragon, the performance is exceptional, whether it's gaming, watching videos, or multitasking. The speed has never been a challenge. Despite concerns about the processor being labeled as old in some YouTube reviews, I believe for typical tablet usage‚Äîchecking emails, watching videos, gaming, or even used for designing and sketching‚Äîthe 870 Snapdragon handles it superbly.The only thing which I have struggled to do is to drag an image from one app (Google Chrome Images) to the another app (WhatsApp).The Dolby Atmos feature enhances the audio quality, providing a delightful experience on media apps like YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, or Spotify (can be availed from the options for all media apps). The speakers on either side deliver tremendous sound quality, and also help create a seamless and smooth (gitterless) video experience.The camera performs well for video calls and capturing document images in good lighting. Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, without any lag.It's important to note that chasing after the latest specifications, such as an upgraded processor and higher camera pixels, often comes with a higher price tag. Brands that promise extensive specifications at a certain price point may not deliver as they claim.In this regard, I believe this Tablet offers great value without compromising on performance.

The best tablet under 30K",N/A,"Been using this tablet for over 6 months now, so I feel like I've adequate experience with it to share a long-term review point by point.Pros:1. Display: The display is a beauty it may not be AMOLED (can't expect at this price) but this IPS display is better than every tablet at this price point. It supports HDR and the content played on it looks marvelous (when it plays properly).2 Performance: The Snapdragon 870 is an old flagship processor but it still performs great for media consumption, it easily decodes different video formats without an issue, I've tested 4K 10bit HEVC files and they work fine and it is also good enough for mid-level gaming. Combined with a 144hz refresh rate the whole experience is just smooth. You might feel some lag only if you open multiple resource-heavy windows side by side.3. Battery and Charging: While traveling when I use it for 4-5 hrs a day, it easily lasts for 2.5 days. The default 33W charger goes from 0 to 100 in 90-100 minutes, this speed is acceptable.4. Speakers: They're decent and loud enough to watch videos in a home environment.5. Camera: It is a tablet so don't expect much but the front cam works well for video calls and the single rear camera takes good photos if given enough light, also it supports 4K 30fps recording. But again do not compare the cameras to phone cameras in the same range.6. USB port and storage: It comes with UFS 3.1 and USB Type-C 3.2, both very fast and useful. The USB port supports 5gbps data transfer and video out feature. Many phones in this range don't come with USB 3.2, hats off to Xiaomi for bringing it in this budget.7. Software: The software is clean and fast, also Xiaomi just updated the device to the new Hyper OS based on Android 14, so the updates scene seems sorted as well.And now Cons:1. Software: See, the overall software experience is great, everything works smoothly and there is no crappy bloatware, BUT there is a major bug in the software which irritates the hell out of me: The Widevine L1 certificate gest disabled most of the time, and because of that Netflix and Prime video stop working in HD, few workarounds and restarts later everything gets back to normal but then again in few days same thing repeats, so to run Netflix and Prime in HD I have to go through this tedious process and waste 5-10 minutes. This bug has been a part of Xiaomi OS since Pad 5, still, Xiaomi has done nothing to fix it for good.2. Accessories: The keyboard cover and stylus offered by Xiaomi are too expensive for the price of the tablet, and the third-party pencils available in the market are meh. Xiaomi should have offered the accessories at a discounted price for the customers.3. Missing 3.5 mm jack and fingerprint sensor: There's enough real estate to put a 3.5 mm jack but Xiaomi chose to be Apple. Also, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor would have been great as the face unlock works well in a lit environment but at night it is useless.4. No 5G option: There's no 5G option available for the tablet, wish Xiomi offered on variant with 5G.5. Extended warranty: There's no extended warranty plan from Xiaomi for this tablet, which is disappointing.Except for the Widevine licensing bug, everything else works in the favour of the tab, and I will happily recommend it to everyone."

Review after 25 days major differences between ios and andriod tab. who should buy or not. read full",N/A,"I bought 8/256 in BB Sale. i was using ipad air gen 2 and confused between mi pad 6, ipad 9th gen and s6 lite. i drooped s6 lite because of screen refresh rate and slow charging , processor etc. i am an andriod user and have window laptop so i chose andriod tablet over ios. because i do not want to pay more for application and i like customization. I thought mi pad 6 is far better then ipad 9th gen. My rating to tablet. Display:- 4.5/5 you get good bigger brighter display. Also have to choose color correction style as per requirement in video tool box which really helpful. Sound:- 3.5/5 Sound are really loud with quad speaker but  clarity of instrument is not good. sometimes you feel background instrument sound compressed. Battery :- 4.5/5 on daily uses to gaming and movie its enough good and fast charge with 33w charger. Its take to full 0 to 100 charge around 90 minutes. Performance :- 4/5 SD 870 is quite good in handling multiple task, split screen and gaming performance is really good. MIUI 4/5 :- I am a MIUI user my first expression with tablet interface was disappointed because it is same as you using a big screen Xiaomi phone. I was expecting more stable and different  interface for tablet as they mentioned that it's different MIUI Tablet OS. Camera:- 3.5/4 not expecting much with tablet camera but just ok camera for document scanning and conference call with always be in Centre conference tool. The last and big difference why ipad still better because of Application Optimization, Many apps not work in landscape mode and no one talked about that in youtube review or nowhere. App like Linkdln, Instagram, News paper apps, and many other student apps not work in landscape mode. many games and application are not smooth as ipad. Its looks like you are using phone application on big screen device sometime pixel density not meet the screen requirements. For Movies and gaming it's a really good device but just for study purpose or drawings go for ipad. because andriod still don't have good apps like ios. i bought stylus also. stylus working smoothly fine but nib lifespan is low.thanks"

The best tablet under 30K",N/A,"Been using this tablet for over 6 months now, so I feel like I've adequate experience with it to share a long-term review point by point.Pros:1. Display: The display is a beauty it may not be AMOLED (can't expect at this price) but this IPS display is better than every tablet at this price point. It supports HDR and the content played on it looks marvelous (when it plays properly).2 Performance: The Snapdragon 870 is an old flagship processor but it still performs great for media consumption, it easily decodes different video formats without an issue, I've tested 4K 10bit HEVC files and they work fine and it is also good enough for mid-level gaming. Combined with a 144hz refresh rate the whole experience is just smooth. You might feel some lag only if you open multiple resource-heavy windows side by side.3. Battery and Charging: While traveling when I use it for 4-5 hrs a day, it easily lasts for 2.5 days. The default 33W charger goes from 0 to 100 in 90-100 minutes, this speed is acceptable.4. Speakers: They're decent and loud enough to watch videos in a home environment.5. Camera: It is a tablet so don't expect much but the front cam works well for video calls and the single rear camera takes good photos if given enough light, also it supports 4K 30fps recording. But again do not compare the cameras to phone cameras in the same range.6. USB port and storage: It comes with UFS 3.1 and USB Type-C 3.2, both very fast and useful. The USB port supports 5gbps data transfer and video out feature. Many phones in this range don't come with USB 3.2, hats off to Xiaomi for bringing it in this budget.7. Software: The software is clean and fast, also Xiaomi just updated the device to the new Hyper OS based on Android 14, so the updates scene seems sorted as well.And now Cons:1. Software: See, the overall software experience is great, everything works smoothly and there is no crappy bloatware, BUT there is a major bug in the software which irritates the hell out of me: The Widevine L1 certificate gest disabled most of the time, and because of that Netflix and Prime video stop working in HD, few workarounds and restarts later everything gets back to normal but then again in few days same thing repeats, so to run Netflix and Prime in HD I have to go through this tedious process and waste 5-10 minutes. This bug has been a part of Xiaomi OS since Pad 5, still, Xiaomi has done nothing to fix it for good.2. Accessories: The keyboard cover and stylus offered by Xiaomi are too expensive for the price of the tablet, and the third-party pencils available in the market are meh. Xiaomi should have offered the accessories at a discounted price for the customers.3. Missing 3.5 mm jack and fingerprint sensor: There's enough real estate to put a 3.5 mm jack but Xiaomi chose to be Apple. Also, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor would have been great as the face unlock works well in a lit environment but at night it is useless.4. No 5G option: There's no 5G option available for the tablet, wish Xiomi offered on variant with 5G.5. Extended warranty: There's no extended warranty plan from Xiaomi for this tablet, which is disappointing.Except for the Widevine licensing bug, everything else works in the favour of the tab, and I will happily recommend it to everyone."

Review after 25 days major differences between ios and andriod tab. who should buy or not. read full",N/A,"I bought 8/256 in BB Sale. i was using ipad air gen 2 and confused between mi pad 6, ipad 9th gen and s6 lite. i drooped s6 lite because of screen refresh rate and slow charging , processor etc. i am an andriod user and have window laptop so i chose andriod tablet over ios. because i do not want to pay more for application and i like customization. I thought mi pad 6 is far better then ipad 9th gen. My rating to tablet. Display:- 4.5/5 you get good bigger brighter display. Also have to choose color correction style as per requirement in video tool box which really helpful. Sound:- 3.5/5 Sound are really loud with quad speaker but  clarity of instrument is not good. sometimes you feel background instrument sound compressed. Battery :- 4.5/5 on daily uses to gaming and movie its enough good and fast charge with 33w charger. Its take to full 0 to 100 charge around 90 minutes. Performance :- 4/5 SD 870 is quite good in handling multiple task, split screen and gaming performance is really good. MIUI 4/5 :- I am a MIUI user my first expression with tablet interface was disappointed because it is same as you using a big screen Xiaomi phone. I was expecting more stable and different  interface for tablet as they mentioned that it's different MIUI Tablet OS. Camera:- 3.5/4 not expecting much with tablet camera but just ok camera for document scanning and conference call with always be in Centre conference tool. The last and big difference why ipad still better because of Application Optimization, Many apps not work in landscape mode and no one talked about that in youtube review or nowhere. App like Linkdln, Instagram, News paper apps, and many other student apps not work in landscape mode. many games and application are not smooth as ipad. Its looks like you are using phone application on big screen device sometime pixel density not meet the screen requirements. For Movies and gaming it's a really good device but just for study purpose or drawings go for ipad. because andriod still don't have good apps like ios. i bought stylus also. stylus working smoothly fine but nib lifespan is low.thanks"

Only cons i could find was the non availability of third party alternatives to xiaomi smart pencil 2nd gen(palm rejection and all other enhanced stylus features work exclusively with xiaomi pencil) which comes with a heavy price tag of 6k itself, the spare tip is also not available in Indian market, which can make xiaomi loose its customer to competitive brands like apple. Also it would be great if xiaomi provided a pdf organizing, editing app similar to xodo like they did with canvas for notemaking and drawing purpose. Hence i am reducing one star."

Overall very good :)",N/A,"Just got my pad yesterday and from first impression view it's very much worth it, the speakers are really good especially if you listen to music encoded in dolby (eg: apple music or tidal).The screen is decent :) maybe we will get a amoled next time :PSince the screen is little different [2.8k display] many apps will not use the full screen properly which is well little sad but i guess it depends on how xiaomi optimises their apps.Netflix though coevered full screen well and i guess perfect as a mutimedia app for this tablet unlike amazon prime or disney plus{keeps playing in 1080p sdr not HDR which is stupid idk why}.Anyways i go enjoy my tab more now xd!!

Great value for Money! Best in its class!!",N/A,"BUYED 8GB RAM, 256GB ROM -After using this Tablet for 50 days, I wanted to share my experience. I was cautious due to some reviews mentioning issues after a few days of usage. However, I can confidently say that the Tablet has exceeded my expectations.Powered by the 870 Snapdragon, the performance is exceptional, whether it's gaming, watching videos, or multitasking. The speed has never been a challenge. Despite concerns about the processor being labeled as old in some YouTube reviews, I believe for typical tablet usage‚Äîchecking emails, watching videos, gaming, or even used for designing and sketching‚Äîthe 870 Snapdragon handles it superbly.The only thing which I have struggled to do is to drag an image from one app (Google Chrome Images) to the another app (WhatsApp).The Dolby Atmos feature enhances the audio quality, providing a delightful experience on media apps like YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, or Spotify (can be availed from the options for all media apps). The speakers on either side deliver tremendous sound quality, and also help create a seamless and smooth (gitterless) video experience.The camera performs well for video calls and capturing document images in good lighting. Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, without any lag.It's important to note that chasing after the latest specifications, such as an upgraded processor and higher camera pixels, often comes with a higher price tag. Brands that promise extensive specifications at a certain price point may not deliver as they claim.In this regard, I believe this Tablet offers great value without compromising on performance.

It supports HDR and the content played on it looks marvelous (when it plays properly).2 Performance: The Snapdragon 870 is an old flagship processor but it still performs great for media consumption, it easily decodes different video formats without an issue, I've tested 4K 10bit HEVC files and they work fine and it is also good enough for mid-level gaming. Combined with a 144hz refresh rate the whole experience is just smooth. You might feel some lag only if you open multiple resource-heavy windows side by side.3. Battery and Charging: While traveling when I use it for 4-5 hrs a day, it easily lasts for 2.5 days. The default 33W charger goes from 0 to 100 in 90-100 minutes, this speed is acceptable.4. Speakers: They're decent and loud enough to watch videos in a home environment.5. Camera: It is a tablet so don't expect much but the front cam works well for video calls and the single rear camera takes good photos if given enough light, also it supports 4K 30fps recording. But again do not compare the cameras to phone cameras in the same range.6. USB port and storage: It comes with UFS 3.1 and USB Type-C 3.2, both very fast and useful. The USB port supports 5gbps data transfer and video out feature. Many phones in this range don't come with USB 3.2, hats off to Xiaomi for bringing it in this budget.7. Software: The software is clean and fast, also Xiaomi just updated the device to the new Hyper OS based on Android 14, so the updates scene seems sorted as well.And now Cons:1. Software: See, the overall software experience is great, everything works smoothly and there is no crappy bloatware, BUT there is a major bug in the software which irritates the hell out of me: The Widevine L1 certificate gest disabled most of the time, and because of that Netflix and Prime video stop working in HD, few workarounds and restarts later everything gets back to normal but then again in few days same thing repeats, so to run Netflix and Prime in HD I have to go through this tedious process and waste 5-10 minutes. This bug has been a part of Xiaomi OS since Pad 5, still, Xiaomi has done nothing to fix it for good.2. Accessories: The keyboard cover and stylus offered by Xiaomi are too expensive for the price of the tablet, and the third-party pencils available in the market are meh. Xiaomi should have offered the accessories at a discounted price for the customers.3. Missing 3.5 mm jack and fingerprint sensor: There's enough real estate to put a 3.5 mm jack but Xiaomi chose to be Apple. Also, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor would have been great as the face unlock works well in a lit environment but at night it is useless.4. No 5G option: There's no 5G option available for the tablet, wish Xiomi offered on variant with 5G.5. Extended warranty: There's no extended warranty plan from Xiaomi for this tablet, which is disappointing.Except for the Widevine licensing bug, everything else works in the favour of the tab, and I will happily recommend it to everyone."

Best tab under @30k",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I got it at @‚Çπ23k flat in Amazon Great Indian Festival. I'm using it for some day let's talk about Pros and Cons till now. üëáüèªProsüëáüèªüëâüèªBuild quality is sturdy and full body is made up of aluminium.üëâüèª Display quality is best with 2.8k 144Hz LCD panle with Dolby Vision. You can easily play 2160p 60fps hdr video on it without any lag or frame skip.üëâüèª Speakers are really awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è. Packed with quad speaker with Dolby Atmos. A full package for multimedia consumption.üëâüèª Performance just leave it üòÖ. It comes with SD870 a most stable processor. If you want to do heavy task or want to play games casual or hardcore no problem you can able to play games at max setting without any lags.üëâüèªIt comes with LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 Storage. My varients is 8Gb/256Gb. There's no lag on app closing/ opening. RAM management is good üòä. Turn Off RAM plus option if don't want lags because it slows down Read/Write speed of secondary memory.üëâüèª Camera's are good for Video Calling or taking pictures of notes that's what you want from a tab.üëâüèªYou can get USB 3.2. You'll get fast transfer speed, Power Delivery support and display output of max 4k@60fps. No one give at this price range.ConsüëáüèªüëâüèªIt comes with 8840mAh battery but due to 2.8k 144Hz display it seems low. But it Depends on you what you are doing. Mine battery didn't last for a day in heavy use.üëâüèªNo headphones jack it's subjective but it's necessary for a tab students use wire headphones during lectures or for gamers also.üëâüèªNo SD Card slot. If you store more lectures and data then it's a issue but you have 2 options 128Gb/256Gb options Choose wisely.üëâüèªSome apps are not optimised for tab it's a big issue sometimes for me.Some apps not working when i install it but after try again and again and then reinstall working well.üëâüèªNo fingerprint sensor it's irritating for me sometimes when I'm using in darküòê. I have switched on bulb or input a long password it really painful üòñ.ConclusionüëáüèªIt's a overall Champian at this price you can everything you want. Buy it and use it without any problems. Overall Performance, Display, Speakers, etc are fabulous üòç. If your budget is under 30k go for it."

Review after 25 days major differences between ios and andriod tab. who should buy or not. read full",N/A,"I bought 8/256 in BB Sale. i was using ipad air gen 2 and confused between mi pad 6, ipad 9th gen and s6 lite. i drooped s6 lite because of screen refresh rate and slow charging , processor etc. i am an andriod user and have window laptop so i chose andriod tablet over ios. because i do not want to pay more for application and i like customization. I thought mi pad 6 is far better then ipad 9th gen. My rating to tablet. Display:- 4.5/5 you get good bigger brighter display. Also have to choose color correction style as per requirement in video tool box which really helpful. Sound:- 3.5/5 Sound are really loud with quad speaker but  clarity of instrument is not good. sometimes you feel background instrument sound compressed. Battery :- 4.5/5 on daily uses to gaming and movie its enough good and fast charge with 33w charger. Its take to full 0 to 100 charge around 90 minutes. Performance :- 4/5 SD 870 is quite good in handling multiple task, split screen and gaming performance is really good. MIUI 4/5 :- I am a MIUI user my first expression with tablet interface was disappointed because it is same as you using a big screen Xiaomi phone. I was expecting more stable and different  interface for tablet as they mentioned that it's different MIUI Tablet OS. Camera:- 3.5/4 not expecting much with tablet camera but just ok camera for document scanning and conference call with always be in Centre conference tool. The last and big difference why ipad still better because of Application Optimization, Many apps not work in landscape mode and no one talked about that in youtube review or nowhere. App like Linkdln, Instagram, News paper apps, and many other student apps not work in landscape mode. many games and application are not smooth as ipad. Its looks like you are using phone application on big screen device sometime pixel density not meet the screen requirements. For Movies and gaming it's a really good device but just for study purpose or drawings go for ipad. because andriod still don't have good apps like ios. i bought stylus also. stylus working smoothly fine but nib lifespan is low.thanks"

Most value for money tablet",N/A,"I wanted a tablet for organizing, reading and creating notes and it has not disappointed so far. Only cons i could find was the non availability of third party alternatives to xiaomi smart pencil 2nd gen(palm rejection and all other enhanced stylus features work exclusively with xiaomi pencil) which comes with a heavy price tag of 6k itself, the spare tip is also not available in Indian market, which can make xiaomi loose its customer to competitive brands like apple. Also it would be great if xiaomi provided a pdf organizing, editing app similar to xodo like they did with canvas for notemaking and drawing purpose. Hence i am reducing one star."

Overall very good :)",N/A,"Just got my pad yesterday and from first impression view it's very much worth it, the speakers are really good especially if you listen to music encoded in dolby (eg: apple music or tidal).The screen is decent :) maybe we will get a amoled next time :PSince the screen is little different [2.8k display] many apps will not use the full screen properly which is well little sad but i guess it depends on how xiaomi optimises their apps.Netflix though coevered full screen well and i guess perfect as a mutimedia app for this tablet unlike amazon prime or disney plus{keeps playing in 1080p sdr not HDR which is stupid idk why}.Anyways i go enjoy my tab more now xd!! Will provide any update if smt happens"

Received with 90% charges and didn't need to charge 3-4 days avg 3-4 hours daily use.(still it was 50% charged)Cons1. Not exactly but bass quality is decent or avg

Good budget wireless Earphones for Running Excercises",N/A,"These earphones are comfortable and sturdy - basically they fit in well with the shark hook in both ears so there's no worry of them falling off or coming out. The design is simple, color is good. As far as the sound quality is concerned, it is decent for some songs but okay for others. For bass, the sound quality could have been better. I have Nirvana Ion earbuds so the sound of these Boat Rockerz is nothing as compared to those earbuds. But for me this is okay since I plan to use these earphones for Jogging/Walking/Running Excercises. The main reason for buying this is they're sturdy, have decent audio in loud environments and are water resistant with their IPX7 rating. Therefore, I believe I can use them comfortably in outdoor rainy environments. 1 year warranty is pretty standard. There were 2 or 3 extra bud sizes available in the box and other content as well. I hope this product won't disappoint me in outdoor activities."

Reliable Performance with a Few Connectivity Hiccups",N/A,"I've been using this product for the last four months, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. Initially offering a backup of around 14 days, even after continuous usage, it still manages an impressive 10-11 days of battery life. My usage mainly revolves around YouTube and calls, and it has proven to be highly reliable in these aspects.Despite its excellent performance, I have encountered occasional connectivity issues where it repeatedly asks to reconnect. However, considering its overall functionality and reliability, this minor drawback doesn't overshadow its effectiveness. Overall, it's a solid product that fulfills its purpose efficiently."

Reliable Performance with a Few Connectivity Hiccups",N/A,"I've been using this product for the last four months, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. Initially offering a backup of around 14 days, even after continuous usage, it still manages an impressive 10-11 days of battery life. My usage mainly revolves around YouTube and calls, and it has proven to be highly reliable in these aspects.Despite its excellent performance, I have encountered occasional connectivity issues where it repeatedly asks to reconnect. However, considering its overall functionality and reliability, this minor drawback doesn't overshadow its effectiveness. Overall, it's a solid product that fulfills its purpose efficiently."

Excellent product but seems used",N/A,The neckband is excellent in performance but it seems that the product is used or re-deliveried.Pros1. Outstanding sound quality2. Extra sound sometimes you don't have to put more than 75% (if you used to put max volume)3. Very very massive battery life. Received with 90% charges and didn't need to charge 3-4 days avg 3-4 hours daily use.(still it was 50% charged)Cons1. Not exactly but bass quality is decent or avg

Good budget wireless Earphones for Running Excercises",N/A,"These earphones are comfortable and sturdy - basically they fit in well with the shark hook in both ears so there's no worry of them falling off or coming out. The design is simple, color is good. As far as the sound quality is concerned, it is decent for some songs but okay for others. For bass, the sound quality could have been better. I have Nirvana Ion earbuds so the sound of these Boat Rockerz is nothing as compared to those earbuds. But for me this is okay since I plan to use these earphones for Jogging/Walking/Running Excercises. The main reason for buying this is they're sturdy, have decent audio in loud environments and are water resistant with their IPX7 rating. Therefore, I believe I can use them comfortably in outdoor rainy environments. 1 year warranty is pretty standard. There were 2 or 3 extra bud sizes available in the box and other content as well. I hope this product won't disappoint me in outdoor activities."

Good laptop.",N/A,"i.) I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. If needing an IPS display because you're too lazy to occasionally adjust the screen is worth Rs.10000 more, be my guest. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else).ii.) This is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are <45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though.iii.) The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which can initially be inconvenient if you use them a lot. In the beginning, my fingers were getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. It's completely fine once you get used to it. However, if you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use.iv.) There's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. You cannot buy a motorcycle and then complain that it does not fly. If you want a good gaming laptop, shell out more than 1 lakh. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well.v.) I have found no problems such as poor sound quality (I use earphones most of the time), battery draining quickly etc. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .vi.) The build quality isn't very strong. So, use the laptop with care. Be gentle when opening and closing the lid. Place the laptop inside a bag when not in use. Otherwise, constant rough use can damage the shell.Edit (15-Nov-23): After a year of heavy use, the LCD cover, bezel (the strip around the monitor) and the back case got damaged. I didn't drop the laptop. Just heavy use. At first, I only saw the damage on the first two components. I registered a complaint with Lenovo online. They sent an engineer and replaced those two components under warranty (no extra charge). However, the damage on the third component is something I only observed when the engineer who came to my house for repairs showed it to me. I asked him to contact Lenovo and send the third part too but they said they won't cover it under warranty. I think if I found it the first time around they would have sent all 3 components. Anyway, overall I'm still happy for now. The back case isn't much of a problem for now once the screws are placed in. It just looks like a crack."

Satisfied with the performance",N/A,"A very good laptop for the money. Snapy in everyday tasks and heavy computing tasks as well. Could give ~90 fps in e sports titles. The only bad thing is the horrible display. Sitting even slightly closer ( average distance on desk ) will make either of corner looks dark because of very poor viewing angles. The only saving grace is reasonable contrast. I use the laptop mostly with external display. Without an external monitor it's hard to use: sit close and end up with one half of screen looking dark or sit far and look at the tiny 15"" display unable to make out any details."

Worst Customer Support and Harassment!!!",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain. Below is the detail incident.Amazon delivered this product ""Lenovo Ideapad-3"" on 06-JUL-2023, Thursday. After unpacking, I powered on the laptop and while going thru the initial settings, I found out that Keypad-1 on the keyboard was not working. This is clearly a hardware issue. So I went about the replacement process and was surprised to find out that first a technician from Amazon will arrive for an inspection and will try to resolve the issue. The technician did not arrive the next day and I had to reschedule again for the next day. So 2 days already lost. Finally the so called technician arrived on 09-JUL-2023, Sunday. The obvious expectation is that he will replace the non-working keypad and resolve. Instead he said he is there only for inspection of any damage and will install and run a diagnostic app which will check for software issues. This is so ridiculous given that the problem is with 1 keypad not working which is a hardware issue. The technician then took a video of the keypad not working and acknowledged the issue and left. I contacted Amazon support and they said that they were waiting for the report from technician and they will contact me after that. No one called anothe 2 days gone and I again followed up today 11-JUN-2023, Tuesday. Shockingly the Amazon support team informed me that the technician has filed a report that issue resolved which is a blatant lie. When I asked them to contact the technician, they were like as per the policy we cannot do that. I just don't understand what is the point in simply beating around the bush with this process and wasting customer's time and harassing the customer like this. Now they said they will arrange for another inspection from technician. This makes no sense as the issue is clearly with hardware. So at the time of writing its 6 days and I am sitting idle with the laptop. The whole point of ordering online is that 7 days replacement guarantee and the confidence. Instead Amazon support simply doing CUSTOMER HARASSMENT and misleading a loyal prime customer. Now I have to wait for the second so called technician to come and not sure what exactly he will do and have no idea as to when the replacement will be done. When we pay the money up-front the expectation is that service and support will work like that. Instead Amazon support is taking CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR GRANTED.After this incident from here-on, I believe a local retailer is far better when it comes to customer support and accountability. Should NEVER BY A HIGH VALUE PRODUCT ONLINE and 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT PROCESS FROM AMAZON IS TURNING TO A HOAX."

Average laptop with average built quality and decent performance",N/A,Good for work and personal use. Built quality would have been better. Artic grey colour is very good which makes the laptop look premium.Screen with less than HD quality and could have been better.Got good exchange price for my old lenovo Intel i3 laptop and hence went ahead with this. Would recommend Dell laptops if given a choice between lenovo ones vs other.

Good laptop.",N/A,"i.) I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. If needing an IPS display because you're too lazy to occasionally adjust the screen is worth Rs.10000 more, be my guest. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else).ii.) This is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are <45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though.iii.) The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which can initially be inconvenient if you use them a lot. In the beginning, my fingers were getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. It's completely fine once you get used to it. However, if you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use.iv.) There's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. You cannot buy a motorcycle and then complain that it does not fly. If you want a good gaming laptop, shell out more than 1 lakh. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well.v.) I have found no problems such as poor sound quality (I use earphones most of the time), battery draining quickly etc. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .vi.) The build quality isn't very strong. So, use the laptop with care. Be gentle when opening and closing the lid. Place the laptop inside a bag when not in use. Otherwise, constant rough use can damage the shell.Edit (15-Nov-23): After a year of heavy use, the LCD cover, bezel (the strip around the monitor) and the back case got damaged. I didn't drop the laptop. Just heavy use. At first, I only saw the damage on the first two components. I registered a complaint with Lenovo online. They sent an engineer and replaced those two components under warranty (no extra charge). However, the damage on the third component is something I only observed when the engineer who came to my house for repairs showed it to me. I asked him to contact Lenovo and send the third part too but they said they won't cover it under warranty. I think if I found it the first time around they would have sent all 3 components. Anyway, overall I'm still happy for now. The back case isn't much of a problem for now once the screws are placed in. It just looks like a crack."

Satisfied with the performance",N/A,"A very good laptop for the money. Snapy in everyday tasks and heavy computing tasks as well. Could give ~90 fps in e sports titles. The only bad thing is the horrible display. Sitting even slightly closer ( average distance on desk ) will make either of corner looks dark because of very poor viewing angles. The only saving grace is reasonable contrast. I use the laptop mostly with external display. Without an external monitor it's hard to use: sit close and end up with one half of screen looking dark or sit far and look at the tiny 15"" display unable to make out any details."

Worst Customer Support and Harassment!!!",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain. Below is the detail incident.Amazon delivered this product ""Lenovo Ideapad-3"" on 06-JUL-2023, Thursday. After unpacking, I powered on the laptop and while going thru the initial settings, I found out that Keypad-1 on the keyboard was not working. This is clearly a hardware issue. So I went about the replacement process and was surprised to find out that first a technician from Amazon will arrive for an inspection and will try to resolve the issue. The technician did not arrive the next day and I had to reschedule again for the next day. So 2 days already lost. Finally the so called technician arrived on 09-JUL-2023, Sunday. The obvious expectation is that he will replace the non-working keypad and resolve. Instead he said he is there only for inspection of any damage and will install and run a diagnostic app which will check for software issues. This is so ridiculous given that the problem is with 1 keypad not working which is a hardware issue. The technician then took a video of the keypad not working and acknowledged the issue and left. I contacted Amazon support and they said that they were waiting for the report from technician and they will contact me after that. No one called anothe 2 days gone and I again followed up today 11-JUN-2023, Tuesday. Shockingly the Amazon support team informed me that the technician has filed a report that issue resolved which is a blatant lie. When I asked them to contact the technician, they were like as per the policy we cannot do that. I just don't understand what is the point in simply beating around the bush with this process and wasting customer's time and harassing the customer like this. Now they said they will arrange for another inspection from technician. This makes no sense as the issue is clearly with hardware. So at the time of writing its 6 days and I am sitting idle with the laptop. The whole point of ordering online is that 7 days replacement guarantee and the confidence. Instead Amazon support simply doing CUSTOMER HARASSMENT and misleading a loyal prime customer. Now I have to wait for the second so called technician to come and not sure what exactly he will do and have no idea as to when the replacement will be done. When we pay the money up-front the expectation is that service and support will work like that. Instead Amazon support is taking CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR GRANTED.After this incident from here-on, I believe a local retailer is far better when it comes to customer support and accountability. Should NEVER BY A HIGH VALUE PRODUCT ONLINE and 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT PROCESS FROM AMAZON IS TURNING TO A HOAX."

If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are <45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though.iii.) The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which can initially be inconvenient if you use them a lot. In the beginning, my fingers were getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. It's completely fine once you get used to it. However, if you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use.iv.) There's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. You cannot buy a motorcycle and then complain that it does not fly. If you want a good gaming laptop, shell out more than 1 lakh. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well.v.) I have found no problems such as poor sound quality (I use earphones most of the time), battery draining quickly etc. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .vi.) The build quality isn't very strong. So, use the laptop with care. Be gentle when opening and closing the lid. Place the laptop inside a bag when not in use. Otherwise, constant rough use can damage the shell.Edit (15-Nov-23): After a year of heavy use, the LCD cover, bezel (the strip around the monitor) and the back case got damaged. I didn't drop the laptop. Just heavy use. At first, I only saw the damage on the first two components. I registered a complaint with Lenovo online. They sent an engineer and replaced those two components under warranty (no extra charge). However, the damage on the third component is something I only observed when the engineer who came to my house for repairs showed it to me. I asked him to contact Lenovo and send the third part too but they said they won't cover it under warranty. I think if I found it the first time around they would have sent all 3 components. Anyway, overall I'm still happy for now. The back case isn't much of a problem for now once the screws are placed in. It just looks like a crack."

Satisfied with the performance",N/A,"A very good laptop for the money. Snapy in everyday tasks and heavy computing tasks as well. Could give ~90 fps in e sports titles. The only bad thing is the horrible display. Sitting even slightly closer ( average distance on desk ) will make either of corner looks dark because of very poor viewing angles. The only saving grace is reasonable contrast. I use the laptop mostly with external display. Without an external monitor it's hard to use: sit close and end up with one half of screen looking dark or sit far and look at the tiny 15"" display unable to make out any details."

Worst Customer Support and Harassment!!!",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain. Below is the detail incident.Amazon delivered this product ""Lenovo Ideapad-3"" on 06-JUL-2023, Thursday. After unpacking, I powered on the laptop and while going thru the initial settings, I found out that Keypad-1 on the keyboard was not working. This is clearly a hardware issue. So I went about the replacement process and was surprised to find out that first a technician from Amazon will arrive for an inspection and will try to resolve the issue. The technician did not arrive the next day and I had to reschedule again for the next day. So 2 days already lost. Finally the so called technician arrived on 09-JUL-2023, Sunday. The obvious expectation is that he will replace the non-working keypad and resolve. Instead he said he is there only for inspection of any damage and will install and run a diagnostic app which will check for software issues. This is so ridiculous given that the problem is with 1 keypad not working which is a hardware issue. The technician then took a video of the keypad not working and acknowledged the issue and left. I contacted Amazon support and they said that they were waiting for the report from technician and they will contact me after that. No one called anothe 2 days gone and I again followed up today 11-JUN-2023, Tuesday. Shockingly the Amazon support team informed me that the technician has filed a report that issue resolved which is a blatant lie. When I asked them to contact the technician, they were like as per the policy we cannot do that. I just don't understand what is the point in simply beating around the bush with this process and wasting customer's time and harassing the customer like this. Now they said they will arrange for another inspection from technician. This makes no sense as the issue is clearly with hardware. So at the time of writing its 6 days and I am sitting idle with the laptop. The whole point of ordering online is that 7 days replacement guarantee and the confidence. Instead Amazon support simply doing CUSTOMER HARASSMENT and misleading a loyal prime customer. Now I have to wait for the second so called technician to come and not sure what exactly he will do and have no idea as to when the replacement will be done. When we pay the money up-front the expectation is that service and support will work like that. Instead Amazon support is taking CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR GRANTED.After this incident from here-on, I believe a local retailer is far better when it comes to customer support and accountability. Should NEVER BY A HIGH VALUE PRODUCT ONLINE and 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT PROCESS FROM AMAZON IS TURNING TO A HOAX."

The loudspeaker is a single speaker not dual. speaker's sound volume is not that high3. Dull display - This device's has a big display but the display is slight yellow in colour. At first I thought night mode or eye protection is on so I checked it and it was not on. So the display is itself slight yellow in colour which can affect multimedia experience. You may not like watching YouTube videos from this device as the video appears yellowish.Update:- After software updates the yellowness has reduced.3. Camera -* Front camera : The device has decent front camera which clicks good selfies but it over whiten's the skin tone so it don't look natural but the selfiesquality is decent to be uploaded in social media.* Rear camera - The rear camera is of decent quality but it don't work very well in low light conditions.

Smooth experience - This device has 120hz display, therefore it's provides smooth scrolling experience if set at 120hz.2. Battery life - This device has good battery life once charged upto 80 percent it can last full day on normal use.3. Fast charging - This device comes with 33 watt fast charger which can charge the 5000 mah battery of this device upto 80 percent in 1 and half hour.Cons : 1. Sound quality - The Microphone sound volume and quality is low, this phone is not for those who use phone primarily for calling as it's sound volume is low so what other person is talking may not be audible sometimes.2. Music sound quality is low - This is not for those who love listening music at high volume since the sound volume is low. The loudspeaker is a single speaker not dual. speaker's sound volume is not that high3. Dull display - This device's has a big display but the display is slight yellow in colour. At first I thought night mode or eye protection is on so I checked it and it was not on. So the display is itself slight yellow in colour which can affect multimedia experience. You may not like watching YouTube videos from this device as the video appears yellowish.Update:- After software updates the yellowness has reduced.3. Camera -* Front camera : The device has decent front camera which clicks good selfies but it over whiten's the skin tone so it don't look natural but the selfiesquality is decent to be uploaded in social media.* Rear camera - The rear camera is of decent quality but it don't work very well in low light conditions. After clicking photo the device takes 2 to 3 seconds to process the image.* Video camera - The videos shot from this device's camera is decent. This phone supports slow motion but the slow motion videos are blurry and faded."

Decent buy if you are a normal user",N/A,"If you're looking for a smartphone for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching movies, then this phone is for you.Pros:1.Display:I'm really surprised by its display. It offers a 120 Hz refresh rate and supports 1080p resolution. When watching a movie, it gives you an immersive experience.2.Sound:The mono speaker offers very good sound quality. The 'real sound technology' in this phone is very useful for watching movies and listening to music.3.Battery:The 5000mAh battery and 33W charger are sufficient. For normal users, the battery gives about 10 hours of screen-on time (SOT).4.Network:5G and 4G work really well. I haven't faced any problems related to network speed or range issues.Cons:1.Processor:This phone uses a very outdated processor. When you try games like BGMI or Free Fire, the phone will start to heat up. Also, when you play for 1 hour or more, there are issues with frame drops, and the game gets laggy.2.Heating Issue:Even with normal use, the phone occasionally gets hot. Sometimes, you can literally fry an egg using the backside of this phone.3.Front Camera:Horrible front camera performance. It doesn't offer the quality of even a below 10K budget phone. The rear camera is decent."

Unleashing Sonic Brilliance: A Comprehensive Review of the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones",N/A,"Diving into the immersive realm of audio, the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic captivate with their promise of Pure Bass Sound and a versatile one-button multi-function control. As an avid audio enthusiast, I recently explored the capabilities of these earphones. This review delves into the design, comfort, sound quality, and overall performance of the JBL C100SI.Design and Construction Quality:The JBL C100SI showcases an elegant, understated design that radiates sophistication. Constructed from durable materials, these earphones blend longevity with a premium touch. The ergonomic design of the ear tips ensures a comfortable and secure fit, ideal for prolonged usage without causing any discomfort. The tangle-free flat cable, a practical addition, minimizes the hassle of dealing with knotted wires. Overall, the build quality mirrors JBL's commitment to combining style with resilience.Comfort:Comfort during prolonged use is paramount, and the JBL C100SI excels in this aspect. The inclusion of three different-sized ear tips in the package allows users to tailor the fit to their ear size, ensuring a snug and secure seal. The lightweight design makes these earphones a suitable choice for extended listening sessions, be it during commutes, workouts, or leisure time at home.Audio Quality:The JBL C100SI lives up to its promise of Pure Bass Sound, a standout feature that elevates the auditory experience. The bass response is robust and profound, adding a layer of depth to the music. Importantly, it doesn't overshadow the mid and high ranges, maintaining a balanced audio profile. Whether you prefer pulsating beats or intricate melodies, these earphones deliver a versatile audio experience across various music genres.The effective noise isolation provided by the well-fitted ear tips enhances the overall audio quality by blocking out ambient noise, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their music or phone calls. The microphone's clarity during calls ensures accurate transmission of your voice without interference.One-Button Multi-Function Control:The incorporation of a one-button control adds to the user-friendly design of these earphones. The single multifunction button enables easy play/pause, call answering/ending, and track skipping. The intuitive layout ensures seamless navigation through audio playback or call management without struggling with your device.Conclusion:In summary, the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic offer an outstanding audio experience, combining elegance, comfort, and impressive sound quality. Whether you're a bass aficionado or someone appreciating a well-rounded audio profile, these earphones deliver on JBL's commitment to Pure Bass Sound. The convenience of the one-button multi-function control makes them a practical choice for everyday use. At their price range, the JBL C100SI emerges as a compelling option for those seeking reliable, high-quality in-ear headphones."

JBL C100SI - Decent Sound, Mixed Bag Experience",N/A,"I recently purchased the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones in the striking red color, and while they deliver on certain fronts, my overall experience falls into the middle ground.Let's start with the positives. The JBL Signature Sound lives up to its reputation, providing a clear and balanced audio experience. The extra deep bass, within the frequency range of 20-20kHz, adds a punch to the music, especially for bass enthusiasts. The sound quality is commendable for the price point, making these headphones a reasonable choice for casual listening.The one-button universal remote with a built-in microphone is a convenient feature. Quick access to Google Assistant or Siri is a plus, allowing for seamless control without taking the phone out of your pocket. The noise-canceling microphone ensures clear communication during calls, even in moderately noisy environments.The sleek, glossy, and ergonomic design of the headphones is visually appealing. They are lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, providing a comfortable fit for most users. The angled buds contribute to a snug fit, enhancing the overall comfort during prolonged use.On the downside, the cable length of 1.2 meters might be a bit shorter than expected, limiting freedom of movement, especially when connected to devices placed at a distance. Additionally, the slip-proof feature is notably absent, which may be a concern for those who are active while wearing headphones.While the metallic finish adds a premium touch, the build quality feels average, and the longevity of the product may raise some questions.In conclusion, the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones offer a decent audio experience with some convenient features. However, the absence of certain elements like slip-proofing and a slightly shorter cable length leaves room for improvement. If you're looking for an affordable option with good sound quality and basic functionality, these headphones might suit your needs. Just be aware of their limitations."

Great Earphones",N/A,I got the earphones delivered on bethe next day just after shipping thanks to Amazon Prime. The earphones are great in terms of build quality and are comfortable to wear. True JBL level sound with proper bass. Great if you are on a budget. I would not recommend getting wireless earphones which are much cheap as of like 500-700 rupees range wireless earphones are just trash where as JBL like 600 rupees earphone still beats wireless earphone in price range of 1000-2000 rupees.

BEWARE OF IT'S DURABILITY!!!!!! Though it sounds really good and all. BUT...>>>>>",N/A,"BUT...>>>>>Let‚Äôs know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it‚Äôs SERVICES!!!!!And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the  Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!! So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-THEN!!!!!AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.inAS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!Thanks  to all of you who read and understand my review.And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù."

Most durable in the price segment.",N/A,"This is the most durable and best earphone in this range. Sound is good, length of wire is good, the only problem is the rubber used in earphone wire. It just get cracks after uses of 2 to 3 months but earphone stillworks  fine. It should come up with enhanced wire quality to make it last long."

Its light build and good quality sound",N/A,"First, its earphones do not come out of my ears. Second its light weight but not so flimsy cords. Third, I liked it's sound very much, it is not able to meet the sound quality standard of my previous JBL corded earphone which I gave to my son. Possibly, the other one was costlier. As per the price, I would say, this corded JBL earphone a great buy."

Unleashing Sonic Brilliance: A Comprehensive Review of the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones",N/A,"Diving into the immersive realm of audio, the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic captivate with their promise of Pure Bass Sound and a versatile one-button multi-function control. As an avid audio enthusiast, I recently explored the capabilities of these earphones. This review delves into the design, comfort, sound quality, and overall performance of the JBL C100SI.Design and Construction Quality:The JBL C100SI showcases an elegant, understated design that radiates sophistication. Constructed from durable materials, these earphones blend longevity with a premium touch. The ergonomic design of the ear tips ensures a comfortable and secure fit, ideal for prolonged usage without causing any discomfort. The tangle-free flat cable, a practical addition, minimizes the hassle of dealing with knotted wires. Overall, the build quality mirrors JBL's commitment to combining style with resilience.Comfort:Comfort during prolonged use is paramount, and the JBL C100SI excels in this aspect. The inclusion of three different-sized ear tips in the package allows users to tailor the fit to their ear size, ensuring a snug and secure seal. The lightweight design makes these earphones a suitable choice for extended listening sessions, be it during commutes, workouts, or leisure time at home.Audio Quality:The JBL C100SI lives up to its promise of Pure Bass Sound, a standout feature that elevates the auditory experience. The bass response is robust and profound, adding a layer of depth to the music. Importantly, it doesn't overshadow the mid and high ranges, maintaining a balanced audio profile. Whether you prefer pulsating beats or intricate melodies, these earphones deliver a versatile audio experience across various music genres.The effective noise isolation provided by the well-fitted ear tips enhances the overall audio quality by blocking out ambient noise, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their music or phone calls. The microphone's clarity during calls ensures accurate transmission of your voice without interference.One-Button Multi-Function Control:The incorporation of a one-button control adds to the user-friendly design of these earphones. The single multifunction button enables easy play/pause, call answering/ending, and track skipping. The intuitive layout ensures seamless navigation through audio playback or call management without struggling with your device.Conclusion:In summary, the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic offer an outstanding audio experience, combining elegance, comfort, and impressive sound quality. Whether you're a bass aficionado or someone appreciating a well-rounded audio profile, these earphones deliver on JBL's commitment to Pure Bass Sound. The convenience of the one-button multi-function control makes them a practical choice for everyday use. At their price range, the JBL C100SI emerges as a compelling option for those seeking reliable, high-quality in-ear headphones."

JBL C100SI - Decent Sound, Mixed Bag Experience",N/A,"I recently purchased the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones in the striking red color, and while they deliver on certain fronts, my overall experience falls into the middle ground.Let's start with the positives. The JBL Signature Sound lives up to its reputation, providing a clear and balanced audio experience. The extra deep bass, within the frequency range of 20-20kHz, adds a punch to the music, especially for bass enthusiasts. The sound quality is commendable for the price point, making these headphones a reasonable choice for casual listening.The one-button universal remote with a built-in microphone is a convenient feature. Quick access to Google Assistant or Siri is a plus, allowing for seamless control without taking the phone out of your pocket. The noise-canceling microphone ensures clear communication during calls, even in moderately noisy environments.The sleek, glossy, and ergonomic design of the headphones is visually appealing. They are lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, providing a comfortable fit for most users. The angled buds contribute to a snug fit, enhancing the overall comfort during prolonged use.On the downside, the cable length of 1.2 meters might be a bit shorter than expected, limiting freedom of movement, especially when connected to devices placed at a distance. Additionally, the slip-proof feature is notably absent, which may be a concern for those who are active while wearing headphones.While the metallic finish adds a premium touch, the build quality feels average, and the longevity of the product may raise some questions.In conclusion, the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones offer a decent audio experience with some convenient features. However, the absence of certain elements like slip-proofing and a slightly shorter cable length leaves room for improvement. If you're looking for an affordable option with good sound quality and basic functionality, these headphones might suit your needs. Just be aware of their limitations."

Great Earphones",N/A,I got the earphones delivered on bethe next day just after shipping thanks to Amazon Prime. The earphones are great in terms of build quality and are comfortable to wear. True JBL level sound with proper bass. Great if you are on a budget. I would not recommend getting wireless earphones which are much cheap as of like 500-700 rupees range wireless earphones are just trash where as JBL like 600 rupees earphone still beats wireless earphone in price range of 1000-2000 rupees.

BEWARE OF IT'S DURABILITY!!!!!! Though it sounds really good and all. BUT...>>>>>",N/A,"BUT...>>>>>Let‚Äôs know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it‚Äôs SERVICES!!!!!And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the  Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!! So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-THEN!!!!!AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.inAS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!Thanks  to all of you who read and understand my review.And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù."

Its light build and good quality sound",N/A,"First, its earphones do not come out of my ears. Second its light weight but not so flimsy cords. Third, I liked it's sound very much, it is not able to meet the sound quality standard of my previous JBL corded earphone which I gave to my son. Possibly, the other one was costlier. As per the price, I would say, this corded JBL earphone a great buy."

Unleashing Sonic Brilliance: A Comprehensive Review of the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones",N/A,"Diving into the immersive realm of audio, the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic captivate with their promise of Pure Bass Sound and a versatile one-button multi-function control. As an avid audio enthusiast, I recently explored the capabilities of these earphones. This review delves into the design, comfort, sound quality, and overall performance of the JBL C100SI.Design and Construction Quality:The JBL C100SI showcases an elegant, understated design that radiates sophistication. Constructed from durable materials, these earphones blend longevity with a premium touch. The ergonomic design of the ear tips ensures a comfortable and secure fit, ideal for prolonged usage without causing any discomfort. The tangle-free flat cable, a practical addition, minimizes the hassle of dealing with knotted wires. Overall, the build quality mirrors JBL's commitment to combining style with resilience.Comfort:Comfort during prolonged use is paramount, and the JBL C100SI excels in this aspect. The inclusion of three different-sized ear tips in the package allows users to tailor the fit to their ear size, ensuring a snug and secure seal. The lightweight design makes these earphones a suitable choice for extended listening sessions, be it during commutes, workouts, or leisure time at home.Audio Quality:The JBL C100SI lives up to its promise of Pure Bass Sound, a standout feature that elevates the auditory experience. The bass response is robust and profound, adding a layer of depth to the music. Importantly, it doesn't overshadow the mid and high ranges, maintaining a balanced audio profile. Whether you prefer pulsating beats or intricate melodies, these earphones deliver a versatile audio experience across various music genres.The effective noise isolation provided by the well-fitted ear tips enhances the overall audio quality by blocking out ambient noise, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their music or phone calls. The microphone's clarity during calls ensures accurate transmission of your voice without interference.One-Button Multi-Function Control:The incorporation of a one-button control adds to the user-friendly design of these earphones. The single multifunction button enables easy play/pause, call answering/ending, and track skipping.

JBL C100SI - Decent Sound, Mixed Bag Experience",N/A,"I recently purchased the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones in the striking red color, and while they deliver on certain fronts, my overall experience falls into the middle ground.Let's start with the positives. The JBL Signature Sound lives up to its reputation, providing a clear and balanced audio experience. The extra deep bass, within the frequency range of 20-20kHz, adds a punch to the music, especially for bass enthusiasts. The sound quality is commendable for the price point, making these headphones a reasonable choice for casual listening.The one-button universal remote with a built-in microphone is a convenient feature. Quick access to Google Assistant or Siri is a plus, allowing for seamless control without taking the phone out of your pocket. The noise-canceling microphone ensures clear communication during calls, even in moderately noisy environments.The sleek, glossy, and ergonomic design of the headphones is visually appealing. They are lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, providing a comfortable fit for most users. The angled buds contribute to a snug fit, enhancing the overall comfort during prolonged use.On the downside, the cable length of 1.2 meters might be a bit shorter than expected, limiting freedom of movement, especially when connected to devices placed at a distance. Additionally, the slip-proof feature is notably absent, which may be a concern for those who are active while wearing headphones.While the metallic finish adds a premium touch, the build quality feels average, and the longevity of the product may raise some questions.In conclusion, the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones offer a decent audio experience with some convenient features. However, the absence of certain elements like slip-proofing and a slightly shorter cable length leaves room for improvement. If you're looking for an affordable option with good sound quality and basic functionality, these headphones might suit your needs. Just be aware of their limitations."

Great Earphones",N/A,I got the earphones delivered on bethe next day just after shipping thanks to Amazon Prime. The earphones are great in terms of build quality and are comfortable to wear. True JBL level sound with proper bass. Great if you are on a budget. I would not recommend getting wireless earphones which are much cheap as of like 500-700 rupees range wireless earphones are just trash where as JBL like 600 rupees earphone still beats wireless earphone in price range of 1000-2000 rupees.

BEWARE OF IT'S DURABILITY!!!!!! Though it sounds really good and all. BUT...>>>>>",N/A,"BUT...>>>>>Let‚Äôs know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it‚Äôs SERVICES!!!!!And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the  Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!! So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-THEN!!!!!AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.inAS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!Thanks  to all of you who read and understand my review.And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù."

JBL C100SI - Decent Sound, Mixed Bag Experience",N/A,"I recently purchased the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones in the striking red color, and while they deliver on certain fronts, my overall experience falls into the middle ground.Let's start with the positives. The JBL Signature Sound lives up to its reputation, providing a clear and balanced audio experience. The extra deep bass, within the frequency range of 20-20kHz, adds a punch to the music, especially for bass enthusiasts. The sound quality is commendable for the price point, making these headphones a reasonable choice for casual listening.The one-button universal remote with a built-in microphone is a convenient feature. Quick access to Google Assistant or Siri is a plus, allowing for seamless control without taking the phone out of your pocket. The noise-canceling microphone ensures clear communication during calls, even in moderately noisy environments.The sleek, glossy, and ergonomic design of the headphones is visually appealing. They are lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, providing a comfortable fit for most users. The angled buds contribute to a snug fit, enhancing the overall comfort during prolonged use.On the downside, the cable length of 1.2 meters might be a bit shorter than expected, limiting freedom of movement, especially when connected to devices placed at a distance. Additionally, the slip-proof feature is notably absent, which may be a concern for those who are active while wearing headphones.While the metallic finish adds a premium touch, the build quality feels average, and the longevity of the product may raise some questions.In conclusion, the JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones offer a decent audio experience with some convenient features. However, the absence of certain elements like slip-proofing and a slightly shorter cable length leaves room for improvement. If you're looking for an affordable option with good sound quality and basic functionality, these headphones might suit your needs. Just be aware of their limitations."

Great Earphones",N/A,I got the earphones delivered on bethe next day just after shipping thanks to Amazon Prime. The earphones are great in terms of build quality and are comfortable to wear. True JBL level sound with proper bass. Great if you are on a budget. I would not recommend getting wireless earphones which are much cheap as of like 500-700 rupees range wireless earphones are just trash where as JBL like 600 rupees earphone still beats wireless earphone in price range of 1000-2000 rupees.

BEWARE OF IT'S DURABILITY!!!!!! Though it sounds really good and all. BUT...>>>>>",N/A,"BUT...>>>>>Let‚Äôs know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it‚Äôs SERVICES!!!!!And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the  Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!! So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-THEN!!!!!AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.inAS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!Thanks  to all of you who read and understand my review.And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù."

Most durable in the price segment.",N/A,"This is the most durable and best earphone in this range. Sound is good, length of wire is good, the only problem is the rubber used in earphone wire. It just get cracks after uses of 2 to 3 months but earphone stillworks  fine. It should come up with enhanced wire quality to make it last long."

These are the cons i Felt.1-  Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get Higher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot from JBL.2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399 (without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all happy with this.4- If You are really a  Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i will not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.=======================How To check Fake Product :=======================Step 1-  In front of the Box  , Under C100SI you will see its Written ""In EAR HEADPHONES"".  It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or anyOther ,its a duplicate.Step 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate Paper. (Small) like a Sticker.  Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.Step 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in duplicate.Step -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with Duplicate.Step -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .Step 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are sustainable ,then your is orginal.=================================How to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :=================================If you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and Quality,  i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps where to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music player. I personally In Love with that app.=============CONCLUSION :=============This product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value of Money. But if  this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you want a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY üí∞-= 3.5 *============MY OPINION :============IF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price Range then Go for it.If you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic  Mi In ear.If you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR 150 Ap.If You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this product.If You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.If you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.IF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.I have Used all the products and Recommending you. If you want those Reviews, Go to my profile and check the Reviews..=====================Was my Review HELPFUL :======================I hope i have Discussed all the questions asked above.

Its light build and good quality sound",N/A,"First, its earphones do not come out of my ears. Second its light weight but not so flimsy cords. Third, I liked it's sound very much, it is not able to meet the sound quality standard of my previous JBL corded earphone which I gave to my son. Possibly, the other one was costlier. As per the price, I would say, this corded JBL earphone a great buy."

Honest review from a student",N/A,"Pros:This device is great if you're under a budget and need it for basic academic purposes. The one I purchased comes with a liftetime subscription of ms office 2021. Size is very compact and anti glare display. Battery life is average, 5hr on idle and 3hrs if you're working on it. It charges pretty fast so that makes up for the battery life. Response time is fast so it is good if you're working on multiple windows. It is overall excellent for the price. It is suitable for web browsing, research, presentations, light video editing and media entertainment. If you want a higher configuration than this, you could go for the Acer aspire lite or the Acer aspire 3 series, they are under 40k.Cons:Device heats up pretty fast, it's not suitable for gaming. Too much cpu usage even while doing basic tasks. Keyboard is a little flimsy however it works fine. It is quite heavy for the size.Overall this laptop is a 7/10. Good product from acer"

It supports a variable refresh rate of up to 90Hz. However, it's noted that the peak brightness of 400 nits may not be sufficient for outdoor use‚Äã‚Äã.Performance and Connectivity: It is equipped with MediaTek's mid-range chipset, featuring a built-in 5G modem that supports multiple bands. This makes it a compelling choice for users in regions where 5G is being rolled out. Its day-to-day performance and camera capabilities are considered decent for its price range‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.Battery Life: The Galaxy M13 is praised for its large battery, which is beneficial for tasks like streaming content, especially over a 5G connection. The decent battery life is a significant plus for users who require long-lasting usage between charges‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.Camera Quality: The primary camera is high-resolution, but the device's performance in low-light photography needs improvement. It also lacks an ultra-wide sensor, which might be a limiting factor for users seeking versatile photography options‚Äã‚Äã.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy M13 5G stands out for its good screen quality, reliable performance, and strong battery life, making it a good option for those on a budget.

....MOGAMBO KHUS HUA!!!....",N/A,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a great tablet for students who are looking for a device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It comes with an S Pen stylus that is included in the box, which makes it easy to take notes, draw, and annotate documents. The stylus also attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, so you don't have to worry about losing it.The tablet has a 10.4-inch TFT display that is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and colors. The screen size is ideal for watching videos, reading e-books, and browsing the web. The tablet also has dual speakers that are tuned by AKG, which deliver clear and loud sound quality.The tablet is powered by an snapdragon processor, which is capable of handling most apps and games smoothly. The tablet also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. The battery life is impressive, as the tablet can last for up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge.The tablet has a sleek and premium design, with a metal back and thin bezels. It is available in three colors: Angora Blue, Oxford Gray, and Chiffon Pink. The tablet is also lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around.The tablet runs on Android 13 with One UI on top, which offers a lot of customization options and features. The tablet also supports Samsung DeX mode, which allows you to connect the tablet to a monitor or TV and use it as a desktop PC. The tablet also has some useful apps pre-installed, such as Samsung Notes, Samsung Kids, and Netflix.The only drawbacks of the tablet are that it does not have an AMOLED display, which would have offered better contrast and colors; it does not have a fingerprint scanner or face unlock, which would have made it more secure; and it does not have a keyboard cover accessory, which would have made it more productive. The s Pen is the magic wand ü™Ñ but it's tip got damaged only after 4 days of use....Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a fantastic tablet for students who want a versatile device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It offers a good display, a powerful performance, a long battery life, a premium design, and an S Pen stylus that is included in the box. It is also priced reasonably compared to other tablets in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is definitely a must-buy for students who are looking for a tablet that can do it all.i got this tab @14999  @ amazon great indian sell and card discount...."

Best budget Android tablet out there.",N/A,"Though I've stopped writing detailed reviews due to lack of time, I just had to write this one. Firstly, a big thanks to Amazon for hassle free exchange and delivery on time! And seller Appario retail once again has impressed me with their quality service.Coming to the tablet, it's hands down the best there is at the budget range.Screen- 8/10 As good as a TFT panel can be, bright enough and vibrant enough. It's no AMOLED but it's great. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, thankfully. There's no light bleed on my unit, as so many have said. Maybe they've fixed the issue. I had a Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a very good display. The contrast level is much better here. Viewing angles could have been little better though.Processor- 8/10 I think nobody's buying this tablet to seriously pursue heavy gaming. For the regular user, the updated SD720G is a very snappy processor. No lags or jitters. I've worked with drawing apps and Rough Animator without any issues at all. RAM plus takes care of multitasking and app management.Battery- good enough to last a day of use. Depends what kind of user you are, for average user it'll last more than a day. Expect SOT of 7-8 hrs at least! Just video streaming can last for 10-11 hrs at medium brightness!S-PEN- 10/10 The reason why most people will be buying this tablet, and it will not disappoint. It takes the whole experience to a different level. Works like a charm, Samsung has fine tuned it over so many years. Worth it!Software- 10/10 Samsung IS the most evolved Android UI there is at the moment. And they have optimised it for tablet. So many features like multi windows, gestures, air command and their integrated ecosystem and features like Samsung Dex work seamlessly for work user experience. Plus Samsung is exceptional nowadays with updates.So my experience with this tablet is awesome and it's the best there is at this range. Period. Some other manufacturers like Lenovo,Realme etc may seemingly give you more bang for the same cost. But nothing can match the overall experience.Overall 8.5/10Value for money- 10/10 as the s-pen is included!"

Best tablet for note making",N/A,"I was looking to buy a tablet for note making and other study purpose since sometimes now. So, I bought this tablet during Amazon Great Indian Sale for 19000. Considering the price this tablet is the best that serve my purpose.  It comes with a S Pen bundled in the box which comes very handy while writing.  Although there are several other Tablets in the market with better configuration like 2k display,120hz refresh rate, better processor etc. from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Lenovo, OPPO etc. But I've selected Samsung for it's good software support and UI features along with the best Notes app that non other brands provide of this quality.  So if anyone looking to buy a tablet for study purpose blindly go for it. For others whose priority is media consumption and gaming than I would like to ask them to look for something else."

Don't expect high experience, decent for students only!",N/A,"This is a budget friendly tab only if you can get it within 20k range, any amount above that will be premium and your loss. I got it from Great Indian Sale for around 20k. Worth it on that price compared to other available option.Screen quality not great, you can see the pixels if you closely observe, but colour optimization is quite good.Sound is good as compared to other tabs in this price range.Battery backup is decent.In box you'll get sim ejector pin and type C cable with an adaptor, that's a pro.Pen is very good but be careful with the Nib, that's quite delicate, but Nib replacements are available at amazon and they're local companies but works fine. So, no worry! but be careful with that thing.With Snapdragon 720G processor and Android 13, gaming performance is quite good, I got amazed by seeing high resolution with very max frame rate in COD Mobile game. But recommended High Graphics and Max frame rate for maximum performance, don't push it to ultimate high it's offering.The only con I've observed still now is the transition effect and OS is little bit laggy sometimes, may be for the low RAM (4GB)."

My views after 4 months of use",N/A,"Update: Recently the company hiked the prices from 23999 to 28999 (Amost 4k) this doesn't make any sense for a mid range tab like this hence I have reduced 2 stars from the review, I don't want to mislead people thinking it's still the best tab. Currently in 20k to 30k you should consider Xiomi pad or IPad because by today's standards 4gb ram might be okay but for movies games and education purposes 64 gb storage is less, it has sd card support but having 64gb inbuilt is kind of scam for a 28k tab------Old review-------At present 20k to 30k tab market makes no sense in indiaYou can find a ipad in this range,  SD 800 series or a below avg SD/600 series with 5g stuffBut why did I opt for a galaxy tab when there were so many more sensible option?Of course it's sensible so sensible I brought 2 tabs, 1 for myself from local store and 2nd one for my sibling from Amazon with exchange offerComing to prosThe screen-Not oled but when you look at it you will feel right at home, not too bright not too washed out, accurate colors and a protable 10 inch form factor. Bezels are just right not too fat not too thin,  extremely thin bezels block certain screen parts when you hold it with both hands with thumbs/quarter palm on the screen.The S pen-I doesn't matter if you previously used any other digital pens, or this is your first- you are gonna love it, great for taking notes, excellent for sketch and drawing too.Honestly the cherry on top is the s pen comes in box unlike many many greedy companies which make you spend additional 5k or astonishingly 10k on them.Before this I was using the dell active pen which came with my 2 in 1 laptop but after using the s pen I guess I can never go back to it. Good thing is it doesn't need any pairing or battery and works right from beginning.The hardware-Honestly I know people feel 4gb/64gb (57-58 usable)is hell of a less at 25k price, what they don't understand is this tab is specifically targeted for students, taking notes or craming for exams won't even take 5gb. Most of us have a smartphone, you gotta remember a tab is just a bigger smartphone and screens are expensive as larger they get and for the quality they provideSd 700series with model 732G is more than enough for even heavier tasks,  I ran Genshin Impact for 3 hrs straight on medium setting 30 fps and didn't had any stuttering or lags, though the tab will get warm or hot depending on room Temps. Now whoever said 4gb ain't enough to run demanding games on Android please show your faces XD .Audio-Comes with Dolby atmos, 3.5mm jack what more you need? Seriously.....Coming to cons.The battery-It ain't oled and it's a big screen so....bye bye battery.I usually get 5 hrs on intense use and around 9-10 hrs SoT (screen on time) on menial usage, so keep that power bank or charger nearbyWeight-When I came from 2 in 1 laptop (1.5 kg) I expected the tab to be lighter of course it was 1 kg lighter but still I feel I'm holding a 500g bornvita pack all the time....not funny and strains my hands,shoulders...etc hope the successor will be more lightweight if there is ever going to be one.Bloatware-Comes with tons and I literally mean it, tons of bloatware you gotta manually Uninstall them or disable them to save battery and storage.Camera-The front, the back and the horrible mic. Both cams are like 460p quality and mic allows too much noise during callsThe final words---Who should buy it?Students, working professionals, music lovers, binge watchers, novice artists.Who should avoid it?Gamers (even if it can run all games you will be left with no storage and SD card storage will be slower), professional Artists,  Apple fans (lol), people who need more storage.Alternatives to S6If you have a lower budget I suggest checking out oppo pad air, or if you want to bump up your spending and buy a more expensive tab you can check the galaxy siblings tab s7+ or tab s8."

Although there are several other Tablets in the market with better configuration like 2k display,120hz refresh rate, better processor etc. from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Lenovo, OPPO etc. But I've selected Samsung for it's good software support and UI features along with the best Notes app that non other brands provide of this quality.  So if anyone looking to buy a tablet for study purpose blindly go for it. For others whose priority is media consumption and gaming than I would like to ask them to look for something else."

Don't expect high experience, decent for students only!",N/A,"This is a budget friendly tab only if you can get it within 20k range, any amount above that will be premium and your loss. I got it from Great Indian Sale for around 20k. Worth it on that price compared to other available option.Screen quality not great, you can see the pixels if you closely observe, but colour optimization is quite good.Sound is good as compared to other tabs in this price range.Battery backup is decent.In box you'll get sim ejector pin and type C cable with an adaptor, that's a pro.Pen is very good but be careful with the Nib, that's quite delicate, but Nib replacements are available at amazon and they're local companies but works fine. So, no worry! but be careful with that thing.With Snapdragon 720G processor and Android 13, gaming performance is quite good, I got amazed by seeing high resolution with very max frame rate in COD Mobile game. But recommended High Graphics and Max frame rate for maximum performance, don't push it to ultimate high it's offering.The only con I've observed still now is the transition effect and OS is little bit laggy sometimes, may be for the low RAM (4GB)."

My views after 4 months of use",N/A,"Update: Recently the company hiked the prices from 23999 to 28999 (Amost 4k) this doesn't make any sense for a mid range tab like this hence I have reduced 2 stars from the review, I don't want to mislead people thinking it's still the best tab. Currently in 20k to 30k you should consider Xiomi pad or IPad because by today's standards 4gb ram might be okay but for movies games and education purposes 64 gb storage is less, it has sd card support but having 64gb inbuilt is kind of scam for a 28k tab------Old review-------At present 20k to 30k tab market makes no sense in indiaYou can find a ipad in this range,  SD 800 series or a below avg SD/600 series with 5g stuffBut why did I opt for a galaxy tab when there were so many more sensible option?Of course it's sensible so sensible I brought 2 tabs, 1 for myself from local store and 2nd one for my sibling from Amazon with exchange offerComing to prosThe screen-Not oled but when you look at it you will feel right at home, not too bright not too washed out, accurate colors and a protable 10 inch form factor. Bezels are just right not too fat not too thin,  extremely thin bezels block certain screen parts when you hold it with both hands with thumbs/quarter palm on the screen.The S pen-I doesn't matter if you previously used any other digital pens, or this is your first- you are gonna love it, great for taking notes, excellent for sketch and drawing too.Honestly the cherry on top is the s pen comes in box unlike many many greedy companies which make you spend additional 5k or astonishingly 10k on them.Before this I was using the dell active pen which came with my 2 in 1 laptop but after using the s pen I guess I can never go back to it. Good thing is it doesn't need any pairing or battery and works right from beginning.The hardware-Honestly I know people feel 4gb/64gb (57-58 usable)is hell of a less at 25k price, what they don't understand is this tab is specifically targeted for students, taking notes or craming for exams won't even take 5gb. Most of us have a smartphone, you gotta remember a tab is just a bigger smartphone and screens are expensive as larger they get and for the quality they provideSd 700series with model 732G is more than enough for even heavier tasks,  I ran Genshin Impact for 3 hrs straight on medium setting 30 fps and didn't had any stuttering or lags, though the tab will get warm or hot depending on room Temps. Now whoever said 4gb ain't enough to run demanding games on Android please show your faces XD .Audio-Comes with Dolby atmos, 3.5mm jack what more you need? Seriously.....Coming to cons.The battery-It ain't oled and it's a big screen so....bye bye battery.I usually get 5 hrs on intense use and around 9-10 hrs SoT (screen on time) on menial usage, so keep that power bank or charger nearbyWeight-When I came from 2 in 1 laptop (1.5 kg) I expected the tab to be lighter of course it was 1 kg lighter but still I feel I'm holding a 500g bornvita pack all the time....not funny and strains my hands,shoulders...etc hope the successor will be more lightweight if there is ever going to be one.Bloatware-Comes with tons and I literally mean it, tons of bloatware you gotta manually Uninstall them or disable them to save battery and storage.Camera-The front, the back and the horrible mic. Both cams are like 460p quality and mic allows too much noise during callsThe final words---Who should buy it?Students, working professionals, music lovers, binge watchers, novice artists.Who should avoid it?Gamers (even if it can run all games you will be left with no storage and SD card storage will be slower), professional Artists,  Apple fans (lol), people who need more storage.Alternatives to S6If you have a lower budget I suggest checking out oppo pad air, or if you want to bump up your spending and buy a more expensive tab you can check the galaxy siblings tab s7+ or tab s8."

Good Product This Is Best Product With Samsung's Trust",N/A,I Bought This For My Sister As She Want's This For Learning And Teaching Online.Best Device With Inbuilt Stylus Support.I Compared This With Lenovo And Xiaomi PadBut Even Their Sales Person Don't Know Wether Their Product Support Stylus Efficiently Or Not Also Stylus Need To Buy Seperately for them.So My Search Got Narrowed To This And I Bought This System Configuration Is Pretty OK For Learning And Teaching Not For Heavy User So Be Mind If You Are Heavy User. Don't Brag About Performance If You Are Exhausting The Device.For Higher Performance Go To S9+ Series Approx 1.5 Lac It's A Beast.

Worth the Money. Recommended.",N/A,"This tab is decent and solves the purpose in most of the cases. Good for Students, Teachers, Researchers, Graphic Artists, and casual Users. The display is good for watching videos on YouTube and OTT platforms. The sound quality is also decent. S pen is also very responsive and can be used for writing, taking notes, drawing/sketching animation, etc. You may download apps like Sketch, Flippa, and Krita from the Google Play Store and make the best use of S-pen. I'm not a gaming enthusiast so haven't tried its performance in that aspect but otherwise, it's the best deal available for Android users in this budget (16-17k). Highly satisfied with this product.

....MOGAMBO KHUS HUA!!!....",N/A,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a great tablet for students who are looking for a device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It comes with an S Pen stylus that is included in the box, which makes it easy to take notes, draw, and annotate documents. The stylus also attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, so you don't have to worry about losing it.The tablet has a 10.4-inch TFT display that is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and colors. The screen size is ideal for watching videos, reading e-books, and browsing the web. The tablet also has dual speakers that are tuned by AKG, which deliver clear and loud sound quality.The tablet is powered by an snapdragon processor, which is capable of handling most apps and games smoothly. The tablet also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. The battery life is impressive, as the tablet can last for up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge.The tablet has a sleek and premium design, with a metal back and thin bezels. It is available in three colors: Angora Blue, Oxford Gray, and Chiffon Pink. The tablet is also lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around.The tablet runs on Android 13 with One UI on top, which offers a lot of customization options and features. The tablet also supports Samsung DeX mode, which allows you to connect the tablet to a monitor or TV and use it as a desktop PC. The tablet also has some useful apps pre-installed, such as Samsung Notes, Samsung Kids, and Netflix.The only drawbacks of the tablet are that it does not have an AMOLED display, which would have offered better contrast and colors; it does not have a fingerprint scanner or face unlock, which would have made it more secure; and it does not have a keyboard cover accessory, which would have made it more productive. The s Pen is the magic wand ü™Ñ but it's tip got damaged only after 4 days of use....Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a fantastic tablet for students who want a versatile device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It offers a good display, a powerful performance, a long battery life, a premium design, and an S Pen stylus that is included in the box. It is also priced reasonably compared to other tablets in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is definitely a must-buy for students who are looking for a tablet that can do it all.i got this tab @14999  @ amazon great indian sell and card discount...."

Best budget Android tablet out there.",N/A,"Though I've stopped writing detailed reviews due to lack of time, I just had to write this one. Firstly, a big thanks to Amazon for hassle free exchange and delivery on time! And seller Appario retail once again has impressed me with their quality service.Coming to the tablet, it's hands down the best there is at the budget range.Screen- 8/10 As good as a TFT panel can be, bright enough and vibrant enough. It's no AMOLED but it's great. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, thankfully. There's no light bleed on my unit, as so many have said. Maybe they've fixed the issue. I had a Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a very good display. The contrast level is much better here. Viewing angles could have been little better though.Processor- 8/10 I think nobody's buying this tablet to seriously pursue heavy gaming. For the regular user, the updated SD720G is a very snappy processor. No lags or jitters. I've worked with drawing apps and Rough Animator without any issues at all. RAM plus takes care of multitasking and app management.Battery- good enough to last a day of use. Depends what kind of user you are, for average user it'll last more than a day. Expect SOT of 7-8 hrs at least! Just video streaming can last for 10-11 hrs at medium brightness!S-PEN- 10/10 The reason why most people will be buying this tablet, and it will not disappoint. It takes the whole experience to a different level. Works like a charm, Samsung has fine tuned it over so many years. Worth it!Software- 10/10 Samsung IS the most evolved Android UI there is at the moment. And they have optimised it for tablet. So many features like multi windows, gestures, air command and their integrated ecosystem and features like Samsung Dex work seamlessly for work user experience. Plus Samsung is exceptional nowadays with updates.So my experience with this tablet is awesome and it's the best there is at this range. Period. Some other manufacturers like Lenovo,Realme etc may seemingly give you more bang for the same cost. But nothing can match the overall experience.Overall 8.5/10Value for money- 10/10 as the s-pen is included!"

Now whoever said 4gb ain't enough to run demanding games on Android please show your faces XD .Audio-Comes with Dolby atmos, 3.5mm jack what more you need? Seriously.....Coming to cons.The battery-It ain't oled and it's a big screen so....bye bye battery.I usually get 5 hrs on intense use and around 9-10 hrs SoT (screen on time) on menial usage, so keep that power bank or charger nearbyWeight-When I came from 2 in 1 laptop (1.5 kg) I expected the tab to be lighter of course it was 1 kg lighter but still I feel I'm holding a 500g bornvita pack all the time....not funny and strains my hands,shoulders...etc hope the successor will be more lightweight if there is ever going to be one.Bloatware-Comes with tons and I literally mean it, tons of bloatware you gotta manually Uninstall them or disable them to save battery and storage.Camera-The front, the back and the horrible mic. Both cams are like 460p quality and mic allows too much noise during callsThe final words---Who should buy it?Students, working professionals, music lovers, binge watchers, novice artists.Who should avoid it?Gamers (even if it can run all games you will be left with no storage and SD card storage will be slower), professional Artists,  Apple fans (lol), people who need more storage.Alternatives to S6If you have a lower budget I suggest checking out oppo pad air, or if you want to bump up your spending and buy a more expensive tab you can check the galaxy siblings tab s7+ or tab s8."

Good Product This Is Best Product With Samsung's Trust",N/A,I Bought This For My Sister As She Want's This For Learning And Teaching Online.Best Device With Inbuilt Stylus Support.I Compared This With Lenovo And Xiaomi PadBut Even Their Sales Person Don't Know Wether Their Product Support Stylus Efficiently Or Not Also Stylus Need To Buy Seperately for them.So My Search Got Narrowed To This And I Bought This System Configuration Is Pretty OK For Learning And Teaching Not For Heavy User So Be Mind If You Are Heavy User. Don't Brag About Performance If You Are Exhausting The Device.For Higher Performance Go To S9+ Series Approx 1.5 Lac It's A Beast.

Worth the Money. Recommended.",N/A,"This tab is decent and solves the purpose in most of the cases. Good for Students, Teachers, Researchers, Graphic Artists, and casual Users. The display is good for watching videos on YouTube and OTT platforms. The sound quality is also decent. S pen is also very responsive and can be used for writing, taking notes, drawing/sketching animation, etc. You may download apps like Sketch, Flippa, and Krita from the Google Play Store and make the best use of S-pen. I'm not a gaming enthusiast so haven't tried its performance in that aspect but otherwise, it's the best deal available for Android users in this budget (16-17k). Highly satisfied with this product. Recommended."

....MOGAMBO KHUS HUA!!!....",N/A,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a great tablet for students who are looking for a device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It comes with an S Pen stylus that is included in the box, which makes it easy to take notes, draw, and annotate documents. The stylus also attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, so you don't have to worry about losing it.The tablet has a 10.4-inch TFT display that is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and colors. The screen size is ideal for watching videos, reading e-books, and browsing the web. The tablet also has dual speakers that are tuned by AKG, which deliver clear and loud sound quality.The tablet is powered by an snapdragon processor, which is capable of handling most apps and games smoothly. The tablet also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. The battery life is impressive, as the tablet can last for up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge.The tablet has a sleek and premium design, with a metal back and thin bezels. It is available in three colors: Angora Blue, Oxford Gray, and Chiffon Pink. The tablet is also lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around.The tablet runs on Android 13 with One UI on top, which offers a lot of customization options and features. The tablet also supports Samsung DeX mode, which allows you to connect the tablet to a monitor or TV and use it as a desktop PC. The tablet also has some useful apps pre-installed, such as Samsung Notes, Samsung Kids, and Netflix.The only drawbacks of the tablet are that it does not have an AMOLED display, which would have offered better contrast and colors; it does not have a fingerprint scanner or face unlock, which would have made it more secure; and it does not have a keyboard cover accessory, which would have made it more productive. The s Pen is the magic wand ü™Ñ but it's tip got damaged only after 4 days of use....Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a fantastic tablet for students who want a versatile device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It offers a good display, a powerful performance, a long battery life, a premium design, and an S Pen stylus that is included in the box. It is also priced reasonably compared to other tablets in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is definitely a must-buy for students who are looking for a tablet that can do it all.i got this tab @14999  @ amazon great indian sell and card discount...."

Best budget Android tablet out there.",N/A,"Though I've stopped writing detailed reviews due to lack of time, I just had to write this one. Firstly, a big thanks to Amazon for hassle free exchange and delivery on time! And seller Appario retail once again has impressed me with their quality service.Coming to the tablet, it's hands down the best there is at the budget range.Screen- 8/10 As good as a TFT panel can be, bright enough and vibrant enough. It's no AMOLED but it's great. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, thankfully. There's no light bleed on my unit, as so many have said. Maybe they've fixed the issue. I had a Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a very good display. The contrast level is much better here. Viewing angles could have been little better though.Processor- 8/10 I think nobody's buying this tablet to seriously pursue heavy gaming. For the regular user, the updated SD720G is a very snappy processor. No lags or jitters. I've worked with drawing apps and Rough Animator without any issues at all. RAM plus takes care of multitasking and app management.Battery- good enough to last a day of use. Depends what kind of user you are, for average user it'll last more than a day. Expect SOT of 7-8 hrs at least! Just video streaming can last for 10-11 hrs at medium brightness!S-PEN- 10/10 The reason why most people will be buying this tablet, and it will not disappoint. It takes the whole experience to a different level. Works like a charm, Samsung has fine tuned it over so many years. Worth it!Software- 10/10 Samsung IS the most evolved Android UI there is at the moment. And they have optimised it for tablet. So many features like multi windows, gestures, air command and their integrated ecosystem and features like Samsung Dex work seamlessly for work user experience. Plus Samsung is exceptional nowadays with updates.So my experience with this tablet is awesome and it's the best there is at this range. Period. Some other manufacturers like Lenovo,Realme etc may seemingly give you more bang for the same cost. But nothing can match the overall experience.Overall 8.5/10Value for money- 10/10 as the s-pen is included!"

Best tablet for note making",N/A,"I was looking to buy a tablet for note making and other study purpose since sometimes now. So, I bought this tablet during Amazon Great Indian Sale for 19000. Considering the price this tablet is the best that serve my purpose.  It comes with a S Pen bundled in the box which comes very handy while writing.  Although there are several other Tablets in the market with better configuration like 2k display,120hz refresh rate, better processor etc. from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Lenovo, OPPO etc. But I've selected Samsung for it's good software support and UI features along with the best Notes app that non other brands provide of this quality.  So if anyone looking to buy a tablet for study purpose blindly go for it. For others whose priority is media consumption and gaming than I would like to ask them to look for something else."

All over best",N/A,"Got this tab during republic day sale at a good discount on sbi credit card.So far the tab has very well impressed me with all its features,however i mostly use it for study purposes .The battery backup is impressive ,s pen is surprising with all its amazing  features.The precision is too good,not laging even a little bit.If u are thinking of buying this tab for study purposes,i would give a huge thumbs up.Lastly i would also give 5 üí´ to the amazon for the speedy delivery of the product.Got this within 4 days."
Subhankar Roy,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Don't expect high experience, decent for students only!",N/A,"This is a budget friendly tab only if you can get it within 20k range, any amount above that will be premium and your loss. I got it from Great Indian Sale for around 20k. Worth it on that price compared to other available option.Screen quality not great, you can see the pixels if you closely observe, but colour optimization is quite good.Sound is good as compared to other tabs in this price range.Battery backup is decent.In box you'll get sim ejector pin and type C cable with an adaptor, that's a pro.Pen is very good but be careful with the Nib, that's quite delicate, but Nib replacements are available at amazon and they're local companies but works fine. So, no worry! but be careful with that thing.With Snapdragon 720G processor and Android 13, gaming performance is quite good, I got amazed by seeing high resolution with very max frame rate in COD Mobile game. But recommended High Graphics and Max frame rate for maximum performance, don't push it to ultimate high it's offering.The only con I've observed still now is the transition effect and OS is little bit laggy sometimes, may be for the low RAM (4GB)."

My views after 4 months of use",N/A,"Update: Recently the company hiked the prices from 23999 to 28999 (Amost 4k) this doesn't make any sense for a mid range tab like this hence I have reduced 2 stars from the review, I don't want to mislead people thinking it's still the best tab. Currently in 20k to 30k you should consider Xiomi pad or IPad because by today's standards 4gb ram might be okay but for movies games and education purposes 64 gb storage is less, it has sd card support but having 64gb inbuilt is kind of scam for a 28k tab------Old review-------At present 20k to 30k tab market makes no sense in indiaYou can find a ipad in this range,  SD 800 series or a below avg SD/600 series with 5g stuffBut why did I opt for a galaxy tab when there were so many more sensible option?Of course it's sensible so sensible I brought 2 tabs, 1 for myself from local store and 2nd one for my sibling from Amazon with exchange offerComing to prosThe screen-Not oled but when you look at it you will feel right at home, not too bright not too washed out, accurate colors and a protable 10 inch form factor. Bezels are just right not too fat not too thin,  extremely thin bezels block certain screen parts when you hold it with both hands with thumbs/quarter palm on the screen.The S pen-I doesn't matter if you previously used any other digital pens, or this is your first- you are gonna love it, great for taking notes, excellent for sketch and drawing too.Honestly the cherry on top is the s pen comes in box unlike many many greedy companies which make you spend additional 5k or astonishingly 10k on them.Before this I was using the dell active pen which came with my 2 in 1 laptop but after using the s pen I guess I can never go back to it. Good thing is it doesn't need any pairing or battery and works right from beginning.The hardware-Honestly I know people feel 4gb/64gb (57-58 usable)is hell of a less at 25k price, what they don't understand is this tab is specifically targeted for students, taking notes or craming for exams won't even take 5gb.

I use it for a couple of hours a day but I've only charged it once from the time I bought and it still doesn't need to get charged. The dopes fit in my small ears well without any pain.

The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them easy to wear for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. I appreciate that they stay securely in place, even during workouts or active movements.The battery life of these earbuds is commendable as well. They provide a substantial playtime on a single charge, allowing for uninterrupted listening throughout the day. The charging case is compact and portable, making it convenient to carry and ensuring that the earbuds are always ready to use.One feature I particularly appreciate is the seamless Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was effortless, and the connection remained stable without any dropouts. The wireless range is impressive, allowing me to move around without being tethered to my device. Additionally, the earbuds feature intuitive touch controls, allowing easy access to play/pause, volume adjustment, and call management.While the overall performance of these earbuds is exceptional, I did encounter a minor drawback. The noise isolation could be improved, especially in louder environments. Although they provide some passive noise reduction, ambient sounds can still be heard, which may affect the immersion in certain situations.In conclusion, these earbuds have impressed me with their superior sound quality, comfort, and convenient features. They offer an immersive listening experience, and their long battery life ensures uninterrupted enjoyment. Despite a minor limitation in noise isolation, these earbuds are a reliable choice for music enthusiasts and individuals seeking a wireless audio solution. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality pair of earbuds."

Excellent product",N/A,I'm writing this review after two months of using it. I have tried several Boat dopes and other dopes from other brands. I can vouch it for it's long lasting battery. I use it for a couple of hours a day but I've only charged it once from the time I bought and it still doesn't need to get charged. The dopes fit in my small ears well without any pain. The sound quality is pretty good for this range and in-call feature is also better than it's rivals. So far all good. Hopefully it'll be the same in the future too.

Worth the purchase!",N/A,"Just received my new Boult Audio Z40 earbuds in white.Here's a short review:Pros:1. Looks pretty good.2. Pairs very fast.3. The mic quality is also decent.Cons:1. The quality of the case could have been better.2. Initially when setting up, only one was working (now the problem's solved).3. They vibrate a little bit whenever listening to bass songs or when on full volume.My overall review is excellent. It's over a month I have been using this and these work excellent. The battery backup is just too good if you use your earbuds atleast 2-3 hours a day.Conclusion - Definitely recommend these. Just buy it during a sale or else the price gets too high."

Pathetic Buying Experience ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",N/A,"Model-Acer Aspire 5,i5-11th Gen,8gb,Iris XE GraphicsTo start with my review, Delivery Time of Laptop was really Quick. Kudos to Amazon Team for that. But there were two issues. Firstly The day when Laptop was supposed to come, Laptop didn't come because it was sent to other are of city. So it got delayed for a day. Secondly,the Delivery Person who was also the person for inspection of my precious laptop exchange was utter Arrogant and was pointing at non existing problems with my old laptop. He didn't even have basic knowledge of Hardware and Software of Laptops and still Amazon had sent this incompetent person for inspection and Laptop pick up. Had to talk with his senior for the delivery of new laptop.Now Coming to laptop,the first 3 days laptop ran really Smoothly. It had no problems whatsoever with any softwares at all. But suddenly one day it wasn't showing any Wifi. The wifi symbol in taskbar was gone. Even in Network settings Wifi wasn't visible. I did Troubleshooting and also checked for Wifi drivers. Wifi driver wasnt at all visible. And Troubleshooting didn't help at all. Now Laptop is frozen at this state and isn't going ahead. I don't know whether it's Software problem or Hardware fault but this is worst experience even after spending Hefty Amount of Money ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.Hence I would say don't buy laptops from Amazon. Rather buy them from Company's Official Store and Website. And I would add avoid Acer Laptop and rather buy HP Laptops as after sells services are far better and experience is also better.Pretty pathetic experience ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI think I've bought Headache after buying this Laptop ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

All rounder",N/A,"Super Fast: This phone is quick. Apps run smoothly and games are fast. Okay Screen: The display is okay, not amazing. Colors are fine, but it could be better. Nice Looks: It's a good-looking phone, for sure. People notice it.Short Battery Life: The battery doesn't last long, especially with 5G.Slow Charging: Even with the 18W charger, it takes a while to charge up.Okay Cameras: The cameras are decent. They take okay pictures, nothing fancy.In short, the Redmi 12 5G is a good phone with a speedy processor, nice looks, and okay cameras. But the battery doesn't last long, and it takes a while to charge. If that's okay with you, it's a solid phone for the price."

Overall good phone",N/A,Using it since few days. I am not heavy gamer or user.  I find this as a fair deal for overall smartihine usage. Battery backup is nice. Having 8gb RAM giving smooth app operating experience. Display and camera are average. Lightweight phone to carry.

Good in Budget",N/A,"Good at this price range, a budget phone does all your needs in a 5G phone, Memory at this price is super, display is quite big when you compare with the pro phones, the only thing, about is The camera though the company says its 50 megapixel, I don't like its Camera quality, all the pictures are comming very dark as compared to my previous Redmi phones, also it does not have the slower version to take vedio, for this you have to buy the Redmi note versions, but there you will sacrifice with the display, as in Redmi notes you will get the smaller display than this,...... Overall its a good phone at this budget but not satisfied with the camera quality, I will give this phone 7/10 rating............."

Amazing in Budget‚ù§Ô∏è",N/A,1.The looks of the phone definately stands out..with That glass backüòå2.Performance is also good as of now but it could be better through Updates..3.Camera is also decent..not so good not so bad4.Speaker quality is also quite good..it won't disappoint you despite being a mono speaker5.There is no issues in Call quality and Signal reception..6.Display is outstanding...but note that you can't play videos smoothly over 1080p7.It is a bit in the taller side...not so narrow..in hand feel isüëç8.No animations but it is still smooth..9. Charging speed is also quite good(roughly 2.5% in 3 min.)..and battery lasts around 7-8 hours in normal usage..overall it can last a day if you are a normal user..If you are looking for a budget 5g phone..this is one of the best for you..Will update it again after an update...

Below average mobile with high price",N/A,"HI lost my Infinix hot 8 mobile so bought this mobile as it is 5G. After 15 days of usage, its performance is below average compared to my previous Infinix mobile. Only good thing is 256 GB storage.  But again you cant extend it. Very frequently we stop getting calls and sms. We get to know this when someone makes whatsapp call to us and remind us. When we reboot mobile this problem is resolved. It has happened 3 times in 15 days. So its permanent problem of this mobile. Camera is very average, dont look at it as 50mp. Quality is just like any other 8mp. There is no front flash. Lot of ads you will find in this mobile and you need to research on internet how to disable all these useless ads and games. So compared to my old 6300 Infinix Hot8 mobile, this 15500 redmi mobile is not worth its cost. It would be good if sold under 8000."

Easy 5g device- good hotspot also",N/A,"I am enjoying 5g access for first time.This device is entry level by amazon and redmi collabration.I bought this for less than 8k with my old redmi 9a  exchange offer.Phone specs  for 4gb ram - I have good OTT apps and screen is good.Usage of 1.7Gb ram by OS is too much though.I hope upcoming updates fix this.Lock screen is finger print -Its good upgrade for me.Experience using other launcher and keypads - I use nova launcher and microsoft swift keypad- gesture control is blocked when you opt for third party launchers - keyboard looks perfect with big screen.There is 3 button at bottom which you cant remove.Bloatware is plenty - I didn't sign in google account immediately - I uninstall most apps.I feel battery drain with my 5g usage ,But yeah great  hotspot for my laptop or tablet.Gaming :Not much into gaming - I play crosswords , spelling games- hardly any issue when playing . This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted  to it.I have mic issues  when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If  looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up."

All rounder",N/A,"Super Fast: This phone is quick. Apps run smoothly and games are fast. Okay Screen: The display is okay, not amazing. Colors are fine, but it could be better. Nice Looks: It's a good-looking phone, for sure. People notice it.Short Battery Life: The battery doesn't last long, especially with 5G.Slow Charging: Even with the 18W charger, it takes a while to charge up.Okay Cameras: The cameras are decent. They take okay pictures, nothing fancy.In short, the Redmi 12 5G is a good phone with a speedy processor, nice looks, and okay cameras. But the battery doesn't last long, and it takes a while to charge. If that's okay with you, it's a solid phone for the price."

Good in Budget",N/A,"Good at this price range, a budget phone does all your needs in a 5G phone, Memory at this price is super, display is quite big when you compare with the pro phones, the only thing, about is The camera though the company says its 50 megapixel, I don't like its Camera quality, all the pictures are comming very dark as compared to my previous Redmi phones, also it does not have the slower version to take vedio, for this you have to buy the Redmi note versions, but there you will sacrifice with the display, as in Redmi notes you will get the smaller display than this,...... Overall its a good phone at this budget but not satisfied with the camera quality, I will give this phone 7/10 rating............."

Amazing in Budget‚ù§Ô∏è",N/A,1.The looks of the phone definately stands out..with That glass backüòå2.Performance is also good as of now but it could be better through Updates..3.Camera is also decent..not so good not so bad4.Speaker quality is also quite good..it won't disappoint you despite being a mono speaker5.There is no issues in Call quality and Signal reception..6.Display is outstanding...but note that you can't play videos smoothly over 1080p7.It is a bit in the taller side...not so narrow..in hand feel isüëç8.No animations but it is still smooth..9. Charging speed is also quite good(roughly 2.5% in 3 min.)..and battery lasts around 7-8 hours in normal usage..overall it can last a day if you are a normal user..If you are looking for a budget 5g phone..this is one of the best for you..Will update it again after an update...

Below average mobile with high price",N/A,"HI lost my Infinix hot 8 mobile so bought this mobile as it is 5G. After 15 days of usage, its performance is below average compared to my previous Infinix mobile. Only good thing is 256 GB storage.  But again you cant extend it. Very frequently we stop getting calls and sms. We get to know this when someone makes whatsapp call to us and remind us. When we reboot mobile this problem is resolved. It has happened 3 times in 15 days. So its permanent problem of this mobile. Camera is very average, dont look at it as 50mp. Quality is just like any other 8mp. There is no front flash. Lot of ads you will find in this mobile and you need to research on internet how to disable all these useless ads and games. So compared to my old 6300 Infinix Hot8 mobile, this 15500 redmi mobile is not worth its cost. It would be good if sold under 8000."

Amazing in Budget‚ù§Ô∏è",N/A,1.The looks of the phone definately stands out..with That glass backüòå2.Performance is also good as of now but it could be better through Updates..3.Camera is also decent..not so good not so bad4.Speaker quality is also quite good..it won't disappoint you despite being a mono speaker5.There is no issues in Call quality and Signal reception..6.Display is outstanding...but note that you can't play videos smoothly over 1080p7.It is a bit in the taller side...not so narrow..in hand feel isüëç8.No animations but it is still smooth..9. Charging speed is also quite good(roughly 2.5% in 3 min.)..and battery lasts around 7-8 hours in normal usage..overall it can last a day if you are a normal user..If you are looking for a budget 5g phone..this is one of the best for you..Will update it again after an update...

Below average mobile with high price",N/A,"HI lost my Infinix hot 8 mobile so bought this mobile as it is 5G. After 15 days of usage, its performance is below average compared to my previous Infinix mobile. Only good thing is 256 GB storage.  But again you cant extend it. Very frequently we stop getting calls and sms. We get to know this when someone makes whatsapp call to us and remind us. When we reboot mobile this problem is resolved. It has happened 3 times in 15 days. So its permanent problem of this mobile. Camera is very average, dont look at it as 50mp. Quality is just like any other 8mp. There is no front flash. Lot of ads you will find in this mobile and you need to research on internet how to disable all these useless ads and games. So compared to my old 6300 Infinix Hot8 mobile, this 15500 redmi mobile is not worth its cost. It would be good if sold under 8000."

Easy 5g device- good hotspot also",N/A,"I am enjoying 5g access for first time.This device is entry level by amazon and redmi collabration.I bought this for less than 8k with my old redmi 9a  exchange offer.Phone specs  for 4gb ram - I have good OTT apps and screen is good.Usage of 1.7Gb ram by OS is too much though.I hope upcoming updates fix this.Lock screen is finger print -Its good upgrade for me.Experience using other launcher and keypads - I use nova launcher and microsoft swift keypad- gesture control is blocked when you opt for third party launchers - keyboard looks perfect with big screen.There is 3 button at bottom which you cant remove.Bloatware is plenty - I didn't sign in google account immediately - I uninstall most apps.I feel battery drain with my 5g usage ,But yeah great  hotspot for my laptop or tablet.Gaming :Not much into gaming - I play crosswords , spelling games- hardly any issue when playing . This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted  to it.I have mic issues  when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If  looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up."

David,N/A,Compact Marvel: SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite Impresses with Performance and Portability,N/A,"I purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite for My Mother as a Christmas gift to replace her old tablet, and it's safe to say that this compact tablet is a true marvel. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my experience:Pros:Compact and Lightweight:The 8.7"" form factor of the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite strikes the perfect balance between screen real estate and portability. It's ideal for on-the-go use, easily fitting into bags and providing a comfortable grip for extended usage.Vivid Display:The display quality is impressive, offering vibrant colors and sharp details. Whether you're watching videos, browsing, or reading, the 8.7-inch screen provides an immersive experience, making it a pleasure to consume content.Decent Performance:The tablet's performance is commendable, handling everyday tasks with ease. Apps load quickly, and multitasking is smooth, thanks to the combination of a quad-core processor and 3GB RAM. It's a reliable companion for both work and entertainment.Expandable Storage:The 32GB internal storage is sufficient for basic needs, but the inclusion of a microSD card slot allows for easy expansion, ensuring you have ample space for your growing library of apps, photos, and media.Long Battery Life:The Galaxy Tab A7 Lite excels in the battery department, providing all-day usage on a single charge. Whether you're binge-watching your favorite series or tackling work tasks, the tablet keeps up without constantly needing to be tethered to a charger.Solid Build Quality:Samsung's commitment to quality is evident in the tablet's build. The sturdy construction instills confidence in its durability, making it suitable for both everyday use and travel.Cons:Basic Camera Performance:While the tablet features both front and rear cameras, the image quality is relatively basic. It serves well for video calls and casual photography but falls short of the standards set by dedicated cameras or smartphones.Mono Speaker:The tablet comes equipped with a single speaker, which, while functional, doesn't provide the stereo experience found in some higher-end models. Audiophiles may find the audio output satisfactory but not exceptional.In conclusion, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is a stellar choice for users seeking a compact, budget-friendly tablet without compromising on performance. Its portability, vibrant display, and reliable performance make it a standout in its category. Despite a couple of minor drawbacks, the overall package offers excellent value for the price. Highly recommended for those in search of a versatile and reliable Android tablet."
Amelia E.,N/A,Great Value for what you pay!,N/A,"We bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. He had a 12 year old iPad 2 that quit updating, so he couldn‚Äôt play any current games and most just stopped working. Consequently, he didn‚Äôt take care of it and broke the screen, so we purchased this tablet before forking out the money for another iPad. I am an apple snob, but I actually really like the tablet. It‚Äôs not as aesthetic as an iPad/iphone, but has all the same apps (Minecraft, among us, Roblox,) that kids are obsessed with and the screen is very high resolution. Our child is very pleased with it. It does lag some, but you can expect that paying  $100 vs $500+. Overall, great kids tablet, definitely faster than the kindle fires."
Eren Henderson,N/A,Little bit slow but still good value,N/A,Slow starting up and slow when you click on anything but perfect for our purposes of using it to read library books.

The long screen is prefect for turning a book sideways. It‚Äôs easy to use and doesn‚Äôt look bad either. The only drawback is the battery doesn‚Äôt last too long but I do get a couple of days out of it so I really can‚Äôt complain. Overall good purchase"

Amelia E.,N/A,Great Value for what you pay!,N/A,"We bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. He had a 12 year old iPad 2 that quit updating, so he couldn‚Äôt play any current games and most just stopped working. Consequently, he didn‚Äôt take care of it and broke the screen, so we purchased this tablet before forking out the money for another iPad. I am an apple snob, but I actually really like the tablet. It‚Äôs not as aesthetic as an iPad/iphone, but has all the same apps (Minecraft, among us, Roblox,) that kids are obsessed with and the screen is very high resolution. Our child is very pleased with it. It does lag some, but you can expect that paying  $100 vs $500+. Overall, great kids tablet, definitely faster than the kindle fires."

Review after thoroughly used.",N/A,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."

Worth Every Square Inch.",N/A,"-------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision.."

Unleash the best with boat headphones",N/A,"I recently invested in a pair of Boat Headphones, and it's safe to say that they've taken my audio experience to the next level. Boat has a reputation for quality, and these headphones certainly live up to the brand's name.Comfort: The first thing I noticed was how comfortable these headphones are. The cushioned ear cups are a dream for extended listening sessions, and the adjustable headband ensures a snug and cozy fit.Sound Quality: Boat didn't cut corners when it comes to sound quality. The audio is crisp and clear, with a perfect balance of bass and treble. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or catching up on podcasts, the immersive sound quality never disappoints.Battery Life: The battery life is another major plus. I can go for hours without worrying about recharging, which is great for long flights or days on the go. Plus, the quick-charging feature is a lifesaver when I'm in a rush.Wireless Convenience: Boat's wireless technology is seamless. Pairing with my devices is a breeze, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable even when I move around my home. It's liberating not to deal with tangled cords!Build Quality: These headphones are built to last. They feel sturdy and durable, and I appreciate the foldable design that makes them easy to pack in my bag when I'm on the move.Noise Cancellation: Boat's noise cancellation feature is a game-changer. It drowns out background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts, no matter where I am.Style: These headphones have a sleek and modern design. The attention to detail in their appearance is evident, and I appreciate that Boat offers a variety of color options to suit individual preferences.In summary, Boat Headphones are a top-notch audio companion. They combine comfort, sound quality, and convenience to provide a fantastic listening experience. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just looking for a reliable pair of headphones, I wholeheartedly recommend Boat's offering. They've certainly earned a permanent spot in my daily routine!"

Working, Durability and Service by the company explained.",N/A,"This product is good for listening music. I listen all kinds of music and this product does the job. But the mic is worst of all and the after sales service and handeling part are explained in detailed manner below:>Bass is good.>Voice is clear and doesn't feel crushed or cracked between the bass and other factors.>Product feels durable if handled with care. But the band part which comes over the head is delicate. It might break soon than imagined on stretching much. The wire joining the left and right cups which is on the edge of band will eventually come out.>The microphone just doesn't work. I think the company is fooling buyers about a mic being there in the headphones. I used the product for about 9 months and I knew from the starting the mic doesn't work. But I just needed the mic to attend calls and hence I registered a complaint on boAt's site. The product was taken from my house and was sent to Mumbai.They replaced the product and now when I've got some other pair of headphones (which I'm sure aren't new) the mic still doesn't work.>Fit: For about a month, I wasn't able to use them for more than 15-20 minutes for a single use. A necessary break was must to ensure that my head doesn't burst but eventually either I got used to it or the headphones adapted themselves. After that, I was able to use them for about an hour or so without any need for break.>After sales service :*Purchased the product in September 2019.*Registered a complaint on boAt's site afer almost 9 months on 31st May.*Request was processed on 9 June i.e 9 days after registration of complaint.*Product was taken on same day and Delhivery was the logistics service which was used to send product to Mumbai.*It took 11 days for product to reach Mumbai service center (which I think is much more time than it should be but I'll not complain due to the pandemic and working conditions.)*After 4 days when the headphones  reached Mumbai, I was sent a mail stating that product is being replaced.*The logistics service used to send them back was Bluedart and was very good and way better than Delhivery. Though it was delayed by 1 day but that's fine because of the 2020 working conditions.*The condition in which I received theproduct was satisfactory.It took almost a mont to replace and send product back but again, I won't complain about that because of working conditions due to Corona virus pandemic.But again coming to point these headphones just don't have mic or even if they have, microphone just doesn't function. This can't be a coincidence because I got 2 products (including the replaced headphones) which sound superb but have the same mic issue.For those who think that mic in these headphones work, it is the phone's or other device's (whatever they use) in-built mic & not the headphones mic.Listening experience is good, but these are not for attending or to make calls."

Good Product",N/A,"A handy pair of headphones with fine sound. I use it mainly to hear streaming-radio news and podcasts ~ it's great for that. I prefer music from stereo speakers. Even so, I tested it for music too and found it good, especially for the bass ranges. It seemed a bit tight around my head at first and I find no adjustment for that, but I got used to it and it's comfortable now. Battery charge lasts long, and it switches off automatically when not in use for a while when you did not turn it off. Easy to connect to Bluetooth devices."

Disappointing Bluetooth | Bad with Low Frequency Music",N/A,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."

""boAt Rockerz 400: Sonic Brilliance with Fragile Build""",N/A,"""Immersive Sound, Limited Durability: boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones offer impressive sound quality with punchy bass and clear highs. The 8-hour playback is convenient for extended use, and the soft padded ear cushions enhance comfort during long sessions.

Review after thoroughly used.",N/A,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."

When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you.

Working, Durability and Service by the company explained.",N/A,"This product is good for listening music. I listen all kinds of music and this product does the job. But the mic is worst of all and the after sales service and handeling part are explained in detailed manner below:>Bass is good.>Voice is clear and doesn't feel crushed or cracked between the bass and other factors.>Product feels durable if handled with care. But the band part which comes over the head is delicate. It might break soon than imagined on stretching much. The wire joining the left and right cups which is on the edge of band will eventually come out.>The microphone just doesn't work. I think the company is fooling buyers about a mic being there in the headphones. I used the product for about 9 months and I knew from the starting the mic doesn't work. But I just needed the mic to attend calls and hence I registered a complaint on boAt's site. The product was taken from my house and was sent to Mumbai.They replaced the product and now when I've got some other pair of headphones (which I'm sure aren't new) the mic still doesn't work.>Fit: For about a month, I wasn't able to use them for more than 15-20 minutes for a single use. A necessary break was must to ensure that my head doesn't burst but eventually either I got used to it or the headphones adapted themselves. After that, I was able to use them for about an hour or so without any need for break.>After sales service :*Purchased the product in September 2019.*Registered a complaint on boAt's site afer almost 9 months on 31st May.*Request was processed on 9 June i.e 9 days after registration of complaint.*Product was taken on same day and Delhivery was the logistics service which was used to send product to Mumbai.*It took 11 days for product to reach Mumbai service center (which I think is much more time than it should be but I'll not complain due to the pandemic and working conditions.)*After 4 days when the headphones  reached Mumbai, I was sent a mail stating that product is being replaced.*The logistics service used to send them back was Bluedart and was very good and way better than Delhivery. Though it was delayed by 1 day but that's fine because of the 2020 working conditions.*The condition in which I received theproduct was satisfactory.It took almost a mont to replace and send product back but again, I won't complain about that because of working conditions due to Corona virus pandemic.But again coming to point these headphones just don't have mic or even if they have, microphone just doesn't function. This can't be a coincidence because I got 2 products (including the replaced headphones) which sound superb but have the same mic issue.For those who think that mic in these headphones work, it is the phone's or other device's (whatever they use) in-built mic & not the headphones mic.Listening experience is good, but these are not for attending or to make calls."

Good Product",N/A,"A handy pair of headphones with fine sound. I use it mainly to hear streaming-radio news and podcasts ~ it's great for that. I prefer music from stereo speakers. Even so, I tested it for music too and found it good, especially for the bass ranges. It seemed a bit tight around my head at first and I find no adjustment for that, but I got used to it and it's comfortable now. Battery charge lasts long, and it switches off automatically when not in use for a while when you did not turn it off. Easy to connect to Bluetooth devices."

Disappointing Bluetooth | Bad with Low Frequency Music",N/A,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."

Review after thoroughly used.",N/A,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."

Worth Every Square Inch.",N/A,"-------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision.."

Working, Durability and Service by the company explained.",N/A,"This product is good for listening music. I listen all kinds of music and this product does the job. But the mic is worst of all and the after sales service and handeling part are explained in detailed manner below:>Bass is good.>Voice is clear and doesn't feel crushed or cracked between the bass and other factors.>Product feels durable if handled with care. But the band part which comes over the head is delicate. It might break soon than imagined on stretching much. The wire joining the left and right cups which is on the edge of band will eventually come out.>The microphone just doesn't work. I think the company is fooling buyers about a mic being there in the headphones. I used the product for about 9 months and I knew from the starting the mic doesn't work. But I just needed the mic to attend calls and hence I registered a complaint on boAt's site. The product was taken from my house and was sent to Mumbai.They replaced the product and now when I've got some other pair of headphones (which I'm sure aren't new) the mic still doesn't work.>Fit: For about a month, I wasn't able to use them for more than 15-20 minutes for a single use. A necessary break was must to ensure that my head doesn't burst but eventually either I got used to it or the headphones adapted themselves. After that, I was able to use them for about an hour or so without any need for break.>After sales service :*Purchased the product in September 2019.*Registered a complaint on boAt's site afer almost 9 months on 31st May.*Request was processed on 9 June i.e 9 days after registration of complaint.*Product was taken on same day and Delhivery was the logistics service which was used to send product to Mumbai.*It took 11 days for product to reach Mumbai service center (which I think is much more time than it should be but I'll not complain due to the pandemic and working conditions.)*After 4 days when the headphones  reached Mumbai, I was sent a mail stating that product is being replaced.*The logistics service used to send them back was Bluedart and was very good and way better than Delhivery. Though it was delayed by 1 day but that's fine because of the 2020 working conditions.*The condition in which I received theproduct was satisfactory.It took almost a mont to replace and send product back but again, I won't complain about that because of working conditions due to Corona virus pandemic.But again coming to point these headphones just don't have mic or even if they have, microphone just doesn't function. This can't be a coincidence because I got 2 products (including the replaced headphones) which sound superb but have the same mic issue.For those who think that mic in these headphones work, it is the phone's or other device's (whatever they use) in-built mic & not the headphones mic.Listening experience is good, but these are not for attending or to make calls."

Disappointing Bluetooth | Bad with Low Frequency Music",N/A,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works.

But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both.

Review after thoroughly used.",N/A,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."

Worth Every Square Inch.",N/A,"-------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision.."

The cushioned ear cups are a dream for extended listening sessions, and the adjustable headband ensures a snug and cozy fit.Sound Quality: Boat didn't cut corners when it comes to sound quality. The audio is crisp and clear, with a perfect balance of bass and treble. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or catching up on podcasts, the immersive sound quality never disappoints.Battery Life: The battery life is another major plus. I can go for hours without worrying about recharging, which is great for long flights or days on the go. Plus, the quick-charging feature is a lifesaver when I'm in a rush.Wireless Convenience: Boat's wireless technology is seamless. Pairing with my devices is a breeze, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable even when I move around my home. It's liberating not to deal with tangled cords!Build Quality: These headphones are built to last. They feel sturdy and durable, and I appreciate the foldable design that makes them easy to pack in my bag when I'm on the move.Noise Cancellation: Boat's noise cancellation feature is a game-changer. It drowns out background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts, no matter where I am.Style: These headphones have a sleek and modern design.

Working, Durability and Service by the company explained.",N/A,"This product is good for listening music. I listen all kinds of music and this product does the job. But the mic is worst of all and the after sales service and handeling part are explained in detailed manner below:>Bass is good.>Voice is clear and doesn't feel crushed or cracked between the bass and other factors.>Product feels durable if handled with care. But the band part which comes over the head is delicate. It might break soon than imagined on stretching much. The wire joining the left and right cups which is on the edge of band will eventually come out.>The microphone just doesn't work. I think the company is fooling buyers about a mic being there in the headphones. I used the product for about 9 months and I knew from the starting the mic doesn't work. But I just needed the mic to attend calls and hence I registered a complaint on boAt's site. The product was taken from my house and was sent to Mumbai.They replaced the product and now when I've got some other pair of headphones (which I'm sure aren't new) the mic still doesn't work.>Fit: For about a month, I wasn't able to use them for more than 15-20 minutes for a single use. A necessary break was must to ensure that my head doesn't burst but eventually either I got used to it or the headphones adapted themselves. After that, I was able to use them for about an hour or so without any need for break.>After sales service :*Purchased the product in September 2019.*Registered a complaint on boAt's site afer almost 9 months on 31st May.*Request was processed on 9 June i.e 9 days after registration of complaint.*Product was taken on same day and Delhivery was the logistics service which was used to send product to Mumbai.*It took 11 days for product to reach Mumbai service center (which I think is much more time than it should be but I'll not complain due to the pandemic and working conditions.)*After 4 days when the headphones  reached Mumbai, I was sent a mail stating that product is being replaced.*The logistics service used to send them back was Bluedart and was very good and way better than Delhivery. Though it was delayed by 1 day but that's fine because of the 2020 working conditions.*The condition in which I received theproduct was satisfactory.It took almost a mont to replace and send product back but again, I won't complain about that because of working conditions due to Corona virus pandemic.But again coming to point these headphones just don't have mic or even if they have, microphone just doesn't function. This can't be a coincidence because I got 2 products (including the replaced headphones) which sound superb but have the same mic issue.For those who think that mic in these headphones work, it is the phone's or other device's (whatever they use) in-built mic & not the headphones mic.Listening experience is good, but these are not for attending or to make calls."

Good Product",N/A,"A handy pair of headphones with fine sound. I use it mainly to hear streaming-radio news and podcasts ~ it's great for that. I prefer music from stereo speakers. Even so, I tested it for music too and found it good, especially for the bass ranges. It seemed a bit tight around my head at first and I find no adjustment for that, but I got used to it and it's comfortable now. Battery charge lasts long, and it switches off automatically when not in use for a while when you did not turn it off. Easy to connect to Bluetooth devices."

Disappointing Bluetooth | Bad with Low Frequency Music",N/A,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."

""boAt Rockerz 400: Sonic Brilliance with Fragile Build""",N/A,"""Immersive Sound, Limited Durability: boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones offer impressive sound quality with punchy bass and clear highs. The 8-hour playback is convenient for extended use, and the soft padded ear cushions enhance comfort during long sessions. However, the build quality feels somewhat flimsy, especially around the hinges, and the plastic construction might not endure rough handling. The microphone performs adequately for calls. Overall, these headphones deliver great audio for the price but may require gentle handling to maintain their longevity."""

Review after thoroughly used.",N/A,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."

When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind.

Working, Durability and Service by the company explained.",N/A,"This product is good for listening music. I listen all kinds of music and this product does the job. But the mic is worst of all and the after sales service and handeling part are explained in detailed manner below:>Bass is good.>Voice is clear and doesn't feel crushed or cracked between the bass and other factors.>Product feels durable if handled with care. But the band part which comes over the head is delicate. It might break soon than imagined on stretching much. The wire joining the left and right cups which is on the edge of band will eventually come out.>The microphone just doesn't work. I think the company is fooling buyers about a mic being there in the headphones. I used the product for about 9 months and I knew from the starting the mic doesn't work. But I just needed the mic to attend calls and hence I registered a complaint on boAt's site. The product was taken from my house and was sent to Mumbai.They replaced the product and now when I've got some other pair of headphones (which I'm sure aren't new) the mic still doesn't work.>Fit: For about a month, I wasn't able to use them for more than 15-20 minutes for a single use. A necessary break was must to ensure that my head doesn't burst but eventually either I got used to it or the headphones adapted themselves. After that, I was able to use them for about an hour or so without any need for break.>After sales service :*Purchased the product in September 2019.*Registered a complaint on boAt's site afer almost 9 months on 31st May.*Request was processed on 9 June i.e 9 days after registration of complaint.*Product was taken on same day and Delhivery was the logistics service which was used to send product to Mumbai.*It took 11 days for product to reach Mumbai service center (which I think is much more time than it should be but I'll not complain due to the pandemic and working conditions.)*After 4 days when the headphones  reached Mumbai, I was sent a mail stating that product is being replaced.*The logistics service used to send them back was Bluedart and was very good and way better than Delhivery. Though it was delayed by 1 day but that's fine because of the 2020 working conditions.*The condition in which I received theproduct was satisfactory.It took almost a mont to replace and send product back but again, I won't complain about that because of working conditions due to Corona virus pandemic.But again coming to point these headphones just don't have mic or even if they have, microphone just doesn't function. This can't be a coincidence because I got 2 products (including the replaced headphones) which sound superb but have the same mic issue.For those who think that mic in these headphones work, it is the phone's or other device's (whatever they use) in-built mic & not the headphones mic.Listening experience is good, but these are not for attending or to make calls."

Good Product",N/A,"A handy pair of headphones with fine sound. I use it mainly to hear streaming-radio news and podcasts ~ it's great for that. I prefer music from stereo speakers. Even so, I tested it for music too and found it good, especially for the bass ranges. It seemed a bit tight around my head at first and I find no adjustment for that, but I got used to it and it's comfortable now. Battery charge lasts long, and it switches off automatically when not in use for a while when you did not turn it off. Easy to connect to Bluetooth devices."

Disappointing Bluetooth | Bad with Low Frequency Music",N/A,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."

""boAt Rockerz 400: Sonic Brilliance with Fragile Build""",N/A,"""Immersive Sound, Limited Durability: boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones offer impressive sound quality with punchy bass and clear highs. The 8-hour playback is convenient for extended use, and the soft padded ear cushions enhance comfort during long sessions. However, the build quality feels somewhat flimsy, especially around the hinges, and the plastic construction might not endure rough handling. The microphone performs adequately for calls. Overall, these headphones deliver great audio for the price but may require gentle handling to maintain their longevity."""

Review after thoroughly used.",N/A,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."

Worth Every Square Inch.",N/A,"-------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision.."

Unleash the best with boat headphones",N/A,"I recently invested in a pair of Boat Headphones, and it's safe to say that they've taken my audio experience to the next level. Boat has a reputation for quality, and these headphones certainly live up to the brand's name.Comfort: The first thing I noticed was how comfortable these headphones are. The cushioned ear cups are a dream for extended listening sessions, and the adjustable headband ensures a snug and cozy fit.Sound Quality: Boat didn't cut corners when it comes to sound quality. The audio is crisp and clear, with a perfect balance of bass and treble. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or catching up on podcasts, the immersive sound quality never disappoints.Battery Life: The battery life is another major plus. I can go for hours without worrying about recharging, which is great for long flights or days on the go. Plus, the quick-charging feature is a lifesaver when I'm in a rush.Wireless Convenience: Boat's wireless technology is seamless. Pairing with my devices is a breeze, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable even when I move around my home. It's liberating not to deal with tangled cords!Build Quality: These headphones are built to last. They feel sturdy and durable, and I appreciate the foldable design that makes them easy to pack in my bag when I'm on the move.Noise Cancellation: Boat's noise cancellation feature is a game-changer. It drowns out background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts, no matter where I am.Style: These headphones have a sleek and modern design. The attention to detail in their appearance is evident, and I appreciate that Boat offers a variety of color options to suit individual preferences.In summary, Boat Headphones are a top-notch audio companion. They combine comfort, sound quality, and convenience to provide a fantastic listening experience. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just looking for a reliable pair of headphones, I wholeheartedly recommend Boat's offering. They've certainly earned a permanent spot in my daily routine!"

Working, Durability and Service by the company explained.",N/A,"This product is good for listening music. I listen all kinds of music and this product does the job. But the mic is worst of all and the after sales service and handeling part are explained in detailed manner below:>Bass is good.>Voice is clear and doesn't feel crushed or cracked between the bass and other factors.>Product feels durable if handled with care. But the band part which comes over the head is delicate. It might break soon than imagined on stretching much. The wire joining the left and right cups which is on the edge of band will eventually come out.>The microphone just doesn't work. I think the company is fooling buyers about a mic being there in the headphones. I used the product for about 9 months and I knew from the starting the mic doesn't work. But I just needed the mic to attend calls and hence I registered a complaint on boAt's site. The product was taken from my house and was sent to Mumbai.They replaced the product and now when I've got some other pair of headphones (which I'm sure aren't new) the mic still doesn't work.>Fit: For about a month, I wasn't able to use them for more than 15-20 minutes for a single use. A necessary break was must to ensure that my head doesn't burst but eventually either I got used to it or the headphones adapted themselves. After that, I was able to use them for about an hour or so without any need for break.>After sales service :*Purchased the product in September 2019.*Registered a complaint on boAt's site afer almost 9 months on 31st May.*Request was processed on 9 June i.e 9 days after registration of complaint.*Product was taken on same day and Delhivery was the logistics service which was used to send product to Mumbai.*It took 11 days for product to reach Mumbai service center (which I think is much more time than it should be but I'll not complain due to the pandemic and working conditions.)*After 4 days when the headphones  reached Mumbai, I was sent a mail stating that product is being replaced.*The logistics service used to send them back was Bluedart and was very good and way better than Delhivery. Though it was delayed by 1 day but that's fine because of the 2020 working conditions.*The condition in which I received theproduct was satisfactory.It took almost a mont to replace and send product back but again, I won't complain about that because of working conditions due to Corona virus pandemic.But again coming to point these headphones just don't have mic or even if they have, microphone just doesn't function. This can't be a coincidence because I got 2 products (including the replaced headphones) which sound superb but have the same mic issue.For those who think that mic in these headphones work, it is the phone's or other device's (whatever they use) in-built mic & not the headphones mic.Listening experience is good, but these are not for attending or to make calls."

A Solid Mid-Range Contender - OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G",N/A,"I recently got my hands on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G in the eye-catching Aqua Surge color variant, and after using it extensively, I must say it's a solid mid-range smartphone that delivers on many fronts.Design and Build:The Aqua Surge color is refreshing and adds a touch of vibrancy to the device. The phone feels sleek and is relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to hold. The build quality is commendable, and the buttons are tactile. However, the plastic frame might not feel as premium as glass, but it does contribute to keeping the phone lightweight.Display:The 6.43-inch Fluid AMOLED display is vibrant and produces punchy colors with deep blacks. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling and a responsive touch experience. Whether you're streaming videos or playing games, the display impresses with its clarity and vibrancy.Performance:Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 handles daily tasks with ease. The 8GB of RAM ensures smooth multitasking, and the 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos. The phone's 5G capability ensures that you stay future-proofed as 5G networks become more widespread.Camera:The triple-camera setup on the back includes a 64MP main sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The camera system performs well in good lighting conditions, capturing detailed and vibrant shots. The Nightscape mode helps in low-light situations, but there's room for improvement in terms of capturing more details in challenging lighting conditions.Battery Life:The 4,500mAh battery is well-optimized, easily providing a full day of use on a single charge. The Warp Charge 30T fast charging is a game-changer, topping up the battery quickly. However, the absence of wireless charging might disappoint some users.Software:The OnePlus Nord CE 3 runs on OxygenOS, providing a clean and near-stock Android experience. The interface is smooth, and OnePlus has a good track record of providing timely software updates.Conclusion:The OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G is a commendable mid-range device that strikes a balance between performance, design, and affordability. It's a great choice for users looking for a 5G-enabled phone with a smooth display, capable camera system, and a clean Android experience. While there are some compromises, such as the plastic frame and the absence of wireless charging, the overall package makes it a strong contender in the mid-range smartphone market."

Decent OnePlus phone under 30k Segment",N/A,"Have been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others."

Solid battery + performance, average camera, poor build",N/A,"Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range."

Unlock sensor is very slow to appear",N/A,"Post complain, the sensor gets reactive, but once the phone is idle for 30-40 sec, the sensor does not show up to unlock the phone. This is what I didn't like about this phone. On repeatly going to the service center they said things were fine and rejected my claim for a defective phone. Don't know what next to do. Other wise the phone is good to use. Being longer, one hand is difficult to use esp to navigate the top corner of the screen."

Decent Quality in Decent Price.",N/A,"About OnePlus Nord CE3, I would like to mention that the phone is more amazing than my expectations in all aspects except the quality of Camera. For that reason only I deduct one star and gave only 4 starts.  I am writing this review after using this phone for almost a month. And the performance of the phone was exceptionally well thought out the period. I didn't find any difficulty in availing features of the phone. A little bit of heating caused due to heavy usage but it could be avoided, Battery backup is amazing, Display is very clear and colour contrast combination for watching movies and videos is also up to the mark, oxygen OS is performing well. I have updated software three times after purchasing it.This Phone has many good features though it lacks in camera quality and build quality. The main drawback of this phone is that it is not able to provide good quality optimised pictures outdoor and in night mode. You will get decent pictures with front camera but the not with the rear camera. The material used for its outer body doesn't seem to provide it a long term protection, it looks shining but quality of material could have been improved.Overall, I can say that Under this price range, this phone is one of the best options to buy.  #OnePlus  #Never Settle"

Good allrounder mobile but not for gamers and camera also ok with decent details",N/A,For me it's good but still camera is not good and upto the mark as compare to others phone in this price but clicks decent good quality pictures but was expecting more than this under 25k mobile when we see the Sony hardware it's not that quality level so it's request to OnePlus developers that to give software updates regarding camera optimization and also battery optimization and about gaming it's very good in casual gaming but heats up when we use more than 10 to 15 minutes and last thing is about buying mobile through emi my friends don't ever buy phone thru emi with credit card bcos banks are charging hidden charges of GST cgst and all other stuff and around 500 rs my money was taken through all that useless charges bcos I buyed the mobile through ICICI credit card mobile. So avoid emi if possible.

Not that great",N/A,"Honesty I have been using this phone for almost a month now and already I am seeing issues with this phone.I bought this phone for 25k with no discount.1. Battery issue sometimes your battery drains faster and in some scenarios it's just stuck in same percentage for some time unusual. You will get hardly 6hrs of battery life that's it. I charge two times per day counting like this I can say that battery life will become short.2. Gliches I downloaded Mortal combat and opened the game suddenly the phone was not at all responding it kept on flickering between homescreen and lockscreen then I had to restart the phone and I am not sure whether this is a game issue or phone issue.3. OnePlus could have made the OS more user friendly when I longpress on any option it automatically turns it on and off I just wanted to get into options.4. AOD always on display is not optimised properly sometimes the in display fingerprint disappear and I had to unlock it using face unlock.5. Don't expect good quality camera definitely you will get noicy photos average quality photos only you can take.6. Temper glass I have tried many temper glass but I get bubbles on the edges this might the due rounded edges or curved. But trust me still I haven't found a good Temper glass for this nord CE3. Tried almost 5 different brands temper glass.Overall If you are thinking to buy this phone right now go for it because with all the discounts for 22k-23k for Nord CE3 it's worth buying because it has good display, fast charging 80W and better performance with SD 782g, but don't buy it for 25k it's not worth for that amount because of its Average quality Camera, Full Plastic Build quality, and not that great speakers average quality."

Looks wise Good but",N/A,"This is my first one plus and brought with lots of expectation . In the box there it comes , Main Device, user manual, welcome letter, Red cable club card, One plus sticker, sim ejector pin, One free TPU same color case with one plus logo at the back and the 80watt charging adapter with red type c cable.  The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also d√©j√† vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed - - The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part . You can now make wireless payment via Google pay from your credit card virtually . No need to carry card at wallet.- Samsung 6.7inch Amoled display with punch hole camera design and indisplay finger print sensor.- 5000 mah battery with 80 watt superVocc first charge . Battery draining rate is also very less at standard use . Makes full Charge in just 35 minutes.- Snapdragon processor is also capable of goog gaming without any frame drop and lag . The Ram is virtuality expandable upto extra 8GB- During gaming , its large vapor cooling chamber keeps the phone temperature optimal and shows allmost less heating issue. The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always d√©j√† vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware . Otherwise this is a very good balanced phone for every task . I brought at 24,999 , this is the quite ok price rather than it's MRP."

Nord ce3 review",N/A,"Battery department.Fast charging process is very nice. Within half an hour the battery gets charged, but the battery life is not good as it gives hardly 1.5 day backup by normal use.DisplayNot bad, but not good much also, sometimes scrolling issue in YouTube app & i don't feel 120 Hz refresh using in display.cameraGood, i don't have knowledge so much about it, so it is okay for me. even i am very satisfied with camera.ProcessorNo heating issues still, but i personally feel that, when i am opening some application, not fast so much fast like that, i don't know why, but not have good.as like that all, there is some much more, but i don't have enough time to mention here.Thank You"

Unlock sensor is very slow to appear",N/A,"Post complain, the sensor gets reactive, but once the phone is idle for 30-40 sec, the sensor does not show up to unlock the phone. This is what I didn't like about this phone. On repeatly going to the service center they said things were fine and rejected my claim for a defective phone. Don't know what next to do. Other wise the phone is good to use. Being longer, one hand is difficult to use esp to navigate the top corner of the screen."

Decent Quality in Decent Price.",N/A,"About OnePlus Nord CE3, I would like to mention that the phone is more amazing than my expectations in all aspects except the quality of Camera. For that reason only I deduct one star and gave only 4 starts.  I am writing this review after using this phone for almost a month. And the performance of the phone was exceptionally well thought out the period. I didn't find any difficulty in availing features of the phone. A little bit of heating caused due to heavy usage but it could be avoided, Battery backup is amazing, Display is very clear and colour contrast combination for watching movies and videos is also up to the mark, oxygen OS is performing well. I have updated software three times after purchasing it.This Phone has many good features though it lacks in camera quality and build quality. The main drawback of this phone is that it is not able to provide good quality optimised pictures outdoor and in night mode. You will get decent pictures with front camera but the not with the rear camera. The material used for its outer body doesn't seem to provide it a long term protection, it looks shining but quality of material could have been improved.Overall, I can say that Under this price range, this phone is one of the best options to buy.  #OnePlus  #Never Settle"

Good allrounder mobile but not for gamers and camera also ok with decent details",N/A,For me it's good but still camera is not good and upto the mark as compare to others phone in this price but clicks decent good quality pictures but was expecting more than this under 25k mobile when we see the Sony hardware it's not that quality level so it's request to OnePlus developers that to give software updates regarding camera optimization and also battery optimization and about gaming it's very good in casual gaming but heats up when we use more than 10 to 15 minutes and last thing is about buying mobile through emi my friends don't ever buy phone thru emi with credit card bcos banks are charging hidden charges of GST cgst and all other stuff and around 500 rs my money was taken through all that useless charges bcos I buyed the mobile through ICICI credit card mobile. So avoid emi if possible.

Not that great",N/A,"Honesty I have been using this phone for almost a month now and already I am seeing issues with this phone.I bought this phone for 25k with no discount.1. Battery issue sometimes your battery drains faster and in some scenarios it's just stuck in same percentage for some time unusual. You will get hardly 6hrs of battery life that's it. I charge two times per day counting like this I can say that battery life will become short.2. Gliches I downloaded Mortal combat and opened the game suddenly the phone was not at all responding it kept on flickering between homescreen and lockscreen then I had to restart the phone and I am not sure whether this is a game issue or phone issue.3. OnePlus could have made the OS more user friendly when I longpress on any option it automatically turns it on and off I just wanted to get into options.4. AOD always on display is not optimised properly sometimes the in display fingerprint disappear and I had to unlock it using face unlock.5. Don't expect good quality camera definitely you will get noicy photos average quality photos only you can take.6. Temper glass I have tried many temper glass but I get bubbles on the edges this might the due rounded edges or curved. But trust me still I haven't found a good Temper glass for this nord CE3. Tried almost 5 different brands temper glass.Overall If you are thinking to buy this phone right now go for it because with all the discounts for 22k-23k for Nord CE3 it's worth buying because it has good display, fast charging 80W and better performance with SD 782g, but don't buy it for 25k it's not worth for that amount because of its Average quality Camera, Full Plastic Build quality, and not that great speakers average quality."

Looks wise Good but",N/A,"This is my first one plus and brought with lots of expectation . In the box there it comes , Main Device, user manual, welcome letter, Red cable club card, One plus sticker, sim ejector pin, One free TPU same color case with one plus logo at the back and the 80watt charging adapter with red type c cable.  The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also d√©j√† vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed - - The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part . You can now make wireless payment via Google pay from your credit card virtually . No need to carry card at wallet.- Samsung 6.7inch Amoled display with punch hole camera design and indisplay finger print sensor.- 5000 mah battery with 80 watt superVocc first charge . Battery draining rate is also very less at standard use . Makes full Charge in just 35 minutes.- Snapdragon processor is also capable of goog gaming without any frame drop and lag . The Ram is virtuality expandable upto extra 8GB- During gaming , its large vapor cooling chamber keeps the phone temperature optimal and shows allmost less heating issue. The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always d√©j√† vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware . Otherwise this is a very good balanced phone for every task . I brought at 24,999 , this is the quite ok price rather than it's MRP."

A Solid Mid-Range Contender - OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G",N/A,"I recently got my hands on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G in the eye-catching Aqua Surge color variant, and after using it extensively, I must say it's a solid mid-range smartphone that delivers on many fronts.Design and Build:The Aqua Surge color is refreshing and adds a touch of vibrancy to the device. The phone feels sleek and is relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to hold. The build quality is commendable, and the buttons are tactile. However, the plastic frame might not feel as premium as glass, but it does contribute to keeping the phone lightweight.Display:The 6.43-inch Fluid AMOLED display is vibrant and produces punchy colors with deep blacks. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling and a responsive touch experience. Whether you're streaming videos or playing games, the display impresses with its clarity and vibrancy.Performance:Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 handles daily tasks with ease. The 8GB of RAM ensures smooth multitasking, and the 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos. The phone's 5G capability ensures that you stay future-proofed as 5G networks become more widespread.Camera:The triple-camera setup on the back includes a 64MP main sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The camera system performs well in good lighting conditions, capturing detailed and vibrant shots. The Nightscape mode helps in low-light situations, but there's room for improvement in terms of capturing more details in challenging lighting conditions.Battery Life:The 4,500mAh battery is well-optimized, easily providing a full day of use on a single charge. The Warp Charge 30T fast charging is a game-changer, topping up the battery quickly. However, the absence of wireless charging might disappoint some users.Software:The OnePlus Nord CE 3 runs on OxygenOS, providing a clean and near-stock Android experience. The interface is smooth, and OnePlus has a good track record of providing timely software updates.Conclusion:The OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G is a commendable mid-range device that strikes a balance between performance, design, and affordability. It's a great choice for users looking for a 5G-enabled phone with a smooth display, capable camera system, and a clean Android experience. While there are some compromises, such as the plastic frame and the absence of wireless charging, the overall package makes it a strong contender in the mid-range smartphone market."

Decent OnePlus phone under 30k Segment",N/A,"Have been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others."

Solid battery + performance, average camera, poor build",N/A,"Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range."

The material used for its outer body doesn't seem to provide it a long term protection, it looks shining but quality of material could have been improved.Overall, I can say that Under this price range, this phone is one of the best options to buy.  #OnePlus  #Never Settle"

Good allrounder mobile but not for gamers and camera also ok with decent details",N/A,For me it's good but still camera is not good and upto the mark as compare to others phone in this price but clicks decent good quality pictures but was expecting more than this under 25k mobile when we see the Sony hardware it's not that quality level so it's request to OnePlus developers that to give software updates regarding camera optimization and also battery optimization and about gaming it's very good in casual gaming but heats up when we use more than 10 to 15 minutes and last thing is about buying mobile through emi my friends don't ever buy phone thru emi with credit card bcos banks are charging hidden charges of GST cgst and all other stuff and around 500 rs my money was taken through all that useless charges bcos I buyed the mobile through ICICI credit card mobile. So avoid emi if possible.

Not that great",N/A,"Honesty I have been using this phone for almost a month now and already I am seeing issues with this phone.I bought this phone for 25k with no discount.1. Battery issue sometimes your battery drains faster and in some scenarios it's just stuck in same percentage for some time unusual. You will get hardly 6hrs of battery life that's it. I charge two times per day counting like this I can say that battery life will become short.2. Gliches I downloaded Mortal combat and opened the game suddenly the phone was not at all responding it kept on flickering between homescreen and lockscreen then I had to restart the phone and I am not sure whether this is a game issue or phone issue.3. OnePlus could have made the OS more user friendly when I longpress on any option it automatically turns it on and off I just wanted to get into options.4. AOD always on display is not optimised properly sometimes the in display fingerprint disappear and I had to unlock it using face unlock.5. Don't expect good quality camera definitely you will get noicy photos average quality photos only you can take.6. Temper glass I have tried many temper glass but I get bubbles on the edges this might the due rounded edges or curved. But trust me still I haven't found a good Temper glass for this nord CE3. Tried almost 5 different brands temper glass.Overall If you are thinking to buy this phone right now go for it because with all the discounts for 22k-23k for Nord CE3 it's worth buying because it has good display, fast charging 80W and better performance with SD 782g, but don't buy it for 25k it's not worth for that amount because of its Average quality Camera, Full Plastic Build quality, and not that great speakers average quality."

Looks wise Good but",N/A,"This is my first one plus and brought with lots of expectation . In the box there it comes , Main Device, user manual, welcome letter, Red cable club card, One plus sticker, sim ejector pin, One free TPU same color case with one plus logo at the back and the 80watt charging adapter with red type c cable.  The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also d√©j√† vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed - - The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part . You can now make wireless payment via Google pay from your credit card virtually . No need to carry card at wallet.- Samsung 6.7inch Amoled display with punch hole camera design and indisplay finger print sensor.- 5000 mah battery with 80 watt superVocc first charge . Battery draining rate is also very less at standard use . Makes full Charge in just 35 minutes.- Snapdragon processor is also capable of goog gaming without any frame drop and lag . The Ram is virtuality expandable upto extra 8GB- During gaming , its large vapor cooling chamber keeps the phone temperature optimal and shows allmost less heating issue. The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always d√©j√† vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware . Otherwise this is a very good balanced phone for every task . I brought at 24,999 , this is the quite ok price rather than it's MRP."

A Solid Mid-Range Contender - OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G",N/A,"I recently got my hands on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G in the eye-catching Aqua Surge color variant, and after using it extensively, I must say it's a solid mid-range smartphone that delivers on many fronts.Design and Build:The Aqua Surge color is refreshing and adds a touch of vibrancy to the device. The phone feels sleek and is relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to hold. The build quality is commendable, and the buttons are tactile. However, the plastic frame might not feel as premium as glass, but it does contribute to keeping the phone lightweight.Display:The 6.43-inch Fluid AMOLED display is vibrant and produces punchy colors with deep blacks. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling and a responsive touch experience. Whether you're streaming videos or playing games, the display impresses with its clarity and vibrancy.Performance:Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 handles daily tasks with ease. The 8GB of RAM ensures smooth multitasking, and the 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos. The phone's 5G capability ensures that you stay future-proofed as 5G networks become more widespread.Camera:The triple-camera setup on the back includes a 64MP main sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The camera system performs well in good lighting conditions, capturing detailed and vibrant shots. The Nightscape mode helps in low-light situations, but there's room for improvement in terms of capturing more details in challenging lighting conditions.Battery Life:The 4,500mAh battery is well-optimized, easily providing a full day of use on a single charge. The Warp Charge 30T fast charging is a game-changer, topping up the battery quickly. However, the absence of wireless charging might disappoint some users.Software:The OnePlus Nord CE 3 runs on OxygenOS, providing a clean and near-stock Android experience. The interface is smooth, and OnePlus has a good track record of providing timely software updates.Conclusion:The OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G is a commendable mid-range device that strikes a balance between performance, design, and affordability. It's a great choice for users looking for a 5G-enabled phone with a smooth display, capable camera system, and a clean Android experience. While there are some compromises, such as the plastic frame and the absence of wireless charging, the overall package makes it a strong contender in the mid-range smartphone market."

Decent OnePlus phone under 30k Segment",N/A,"Have been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others."

Solid battery + performance, average camera, poor build",N/A,"Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range."

Unlock sensor is very slow to appear",N/A,"Post complain, the sensor gets reactive, but once the phone is idle for 30-40 sec, the sensor does not show up to unlock the phone. This is what I didn't like about this phone. On repeatly going to the service center they said things were fine and rejected my claim for a defective phone. Don't know what next to do. Other wise the phone is good to use. Being longer, one hand is difficult to use esp to navigate the top corner of the screen."

Battery issue sometimes your battery drains faster and in some scenarios it's just stuck in same percentage for some time unusual. You will get hardly 6hrs of battery life that's it. I charge two times per day counting like this I can say that battery life will become short.2. Gliches I downloaded Mortal combat and opened the game suddenly the phone was not at all responding it kept on flickering between homescreen and lockscreen then I had to restart the phone and I am not sure whether this is a game issue or phone issue.3. OnePlus could have made the OS more user friendly when I longpress on any option it automatically turns it on and off I just wanted to get into options.4. AOD always on display is not optimised properly sometimes the in display fingerprint disappear and I had to unlock it using face unlock.5. Don't expect good quality camera definitely you will get noicy photos average quality photos only you can take.6. Temper glass I have tried many temper glass but I get bubbles on the edges this might the due rounded edges or curved. But trust me still I haven't found a good Temper glass for this nord CE3. Tried almost 5 different brands temper glass.Overall If you are thinking to buy this phone right now go for it because with all the discounts for 22k-23k for Nord CE3 it's worth buying because it has good display, fast charging 80W and better performance with SD 782g, but don't buy it for 25k it's not worth for that amount because of its Average quality Camera, Full Plastic Build quality, and not that great speakers average quality."

Looks wise Good but",N/A,"This is my first one plus and brought with lots of expectation . In the box there it comes , Main Device, user manual, welcome letter, Red cable club card, One plus sticker, sim ejector pin, One free TPU same color case with one plus logo at the back and the 80watt charging adapter with red type c cable.  The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also d√©j√† vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed - - The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part . You can now make wireless payment via Google pay from your credit card virtually . No need to carry card at wallet.- Samsung 6.7inch Amoled display with punch hole camera design and indisplay finger print sensor.- 5000 mah battery with 80 watt superVocc first charge . Battery draining rate is also very less at standard use . Makes full Charge in just 35 minutes.- Snapdragon processor is also capable of goog gaming without any frame drop and lag . The Ram is virtuality expandable upto extra 8GB- During gaming , its large vapor cooling chamber keeps the phone temperature optimal and shows allmost less heating issue. The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always d√©j√† vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware . Otherwise this is a very good balanced phone for every task . I brought at 24,999 , this is the quite ok price rather than it's MRP."

Nord ce3 review",N/A,"Battery department.Fast charging process is very nice. Within half an hour the battery gets charged, but the battery life is not good as it gives hardly 1.5 day backup by normal use.DisplayNot bad, but not good much also, sometimes scrolling issue in YouTube app & i don't feel 120 Hz refresh using in display.cameraGood, i don't have knowledge so much about it, so it is okay for me. even i am very satisfied with camera.ProcessorNo heating issues still, but i personally feel that, when i am opening some application, not fast so much fast like that, i don't know why, but not have good.as like that all, there is some much more, but i don't have enough time to mention here.Thank You"

15k couldnt get much better or can it?",N/A,"Design - for the price. Impressed with the build quality. Metal body feels premium. Minimum bezels gave this advantage over me choosing this instead of the iPad 6th gen. Watching video on this aspect is perfect. Fingerprint sensor would have made a perfect addition but not a deal breaker. The volume and power button feels nice and tactile. Easy to identify too. USB C is perfect as now tab and phone don't need two different cables. iPad loses out here too in terms of convenience. speaker is loud enough, but slight vibration in the body is felt at higher volumes. Screen isnt the greatest but its not bad. Its crisp enough for an LCD. watching videos at 1080p is good. not expecting amoled quality hereSoftware - As an android user. Using an android tablet feels easier than to use an iOS device. Google apps work great. Never used One-UI before. Quite impressed. As an Android one user with clean android likes. This seems to impress. Running on the latest version of Android also is good too with the tab in its price range compared to its competition offering older software versions.Camera- Not too impressed with it. But who uses tablets for photography. Will let it slide. For video chat it does the job. Nothing to complain.Performance - specs on paper doesn't tell the whole story. 2gb seems low but for basic tasks which the tab is meant for. its totally fine. i guess thats how they got it to be on the cheaper side. most apps load fast. i havent done any major multi tasking. but two windows side by side and a third pop up view window didnt show any lag. not saying is smooth as an ipad. you do get the occasional lags, stutters and what not. like while shifting from landscape to portrait. takes a sec to fill the window. batter life seems good for now. no complaints there. the software and ram management will take a while to understand your uses so be patient.Verdict - if you're in the Google ecosystem go for it if it's just for everyday tasks of reading, watching videos, light games, music. Does the job with ease. iPad too is great but I personally it's more in sync if you're in the apple ecosystem. If you expect high end performance don't get your hopes up. Wait and get the Tab S6. If I'd have to rate it , it would be a 4/5 . for 15k what do you expect in a tablet?"

Good screen, Good battery life, but slow device",N/A,"Very good media consumption device at this price range. Screen quality is very good. Excellent battery life. Nice speakers, decent camera for video calling,Most disappointing is the slow processor and RAM. With 3-4 apps open (including chrome), it becomes very slow in responding. But with 2GB ram, nothing more is expected.Good for simple usage - checking mails, viewing photos, video calls, browsing (online shopping*), news reading, media apps** etc. Definitely not multitasking even though it allows split screen - small apps would work fine.Noticed some bugs -*Amazon India app is buggy for this tablet. it already gives a notification - 'app is not optimized for this screen size'. But amazon.com works perfectly fine. I don't know if any other apps are not optimized for the tablet size.**Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube etc are fine - except Hotstar gives a white bar at the bottom(from navigation button's bar). This is so annoying for me because there is dark background in the video and then bright bar!!) .------------------------------Nevertheless this is a wonderful and sleek tablet at the price range. So, 5 stars from me. If it had 3GB ram even at Rs.1000 extra, it would become the king in the segment."

Welcome to 2015 with 2GB of Ram",N/A,"Spoiler Alert: This Tab can't even load two tabs in browser side by side.Build Quality: First of all build quality of this tab is good & sturdy with Metal Back & Laminated display.Display: Display quality is also good & sharp. Viewing angles are good too. SUPPORTS 10 FINGER MULTITOUCH.Sound: Stereo speakers are situated on the same side of the tab. So you won't feel any serious effect. Overall sound quality is good and loud.Connectivity & Sensor: You'll get Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, TYPE C USB port & Accelerometer. NO AUTO BRIGHTNESS SENSOR or Finger print.Camera: Don't bother about the camera of a tablet. Front camera is useless back camera is average.Internal: 23GB out of 32GB is free. Comes with some bundled bloatwares like ms office which you can't uninstall. 14nm Edynos 7904 do get its job done. But the main problems is the limited 2GB Ram. Forget about playing PUBG. it's lagging too much. The tab even failed to keep in memory two opened browser tab side by side(Amazon & Flipkart webpage) & reloads when switching between them. There should be a 3GB Ram version launched in India.Battery: Very happy about the battery backup of 6100mah battery. Battery drops only 25% on constant using(screen on time of 4hours). #Will update later.#Final verdict: Only for very basic task like media consuming & reading.If you intent to play games like PUBG or multitask, then you should forget about this. 2GB Ram is very little in 2019 standard."

User Review after one month of usage",N/A,"I was worried about the performance because of 2 gb ram, but to my utter surprise the device works fine, it knows its capacity and accordingly it manages the whole system so as to provides smooth and uninterrupted experience.  Im loving it, no lags as of now, can't say about future. I'm using everything except gaming. Payment apps can't be used without sim card so does not work on the wifi version, like paytm, Google pay etc. There are apps which might not be optimized for using in tablets and so they are not available for downloads like my jio, swiggy etc Overall evaluate the cost and benefit of having a tablet, regarding apps these are the inherent limitations of a wifi tablet, nothing to do about Samsung. Rest is quite satisfactory and definitely its value for money.UpdateAfter one month of use, still not faced any issues, except little lag when too many apps are open and try to switch between apps. Back camera serves the purpose of capturing images of documents for scanning and front camera could have been better, during video calls my video is always blur, tried using different apps like Duo, hike, whatapp etc on 4g internet, 5 mp cam of iPhone gives so clear images and video quality, little disappointing so far front cam is concerned.For reading pdf files I am using acrobat and xodo, you can highlight, underline, strikethrough, use free hand pen, add comments while reading. There are other features as well. For note taking its not much friendly as palm rejection is not supported, but it works fine otherwise. I am using ELV stylus for reading and casual marking on pdfs.The device looks premium and whoever sees it, does not belive that its price is 15000, people thinks its worth will be around 25K or 30K. Thank you samsung for the device and thank you amazon for everything."

Best in Budget",N/A,"Seeing the specifications it seemed Samsung has launched this Tab with the sole purpose of playing videos which actually was the sole need for which I was looking for a Tab. And the Tab does its job good enough that me and my friends were impressed by its performance.Not a super amoled screen, but if not kept side by side with one, it will be difficult to spot the difference for a rookie like me. Display is much much better than any other Tab in this price point. 10 inch is perfect for me. Samsung does have the best displays in its devices.2GB ram is the only drawback I see in it, however as I said its sufficient for watching videos. Good enough for Amazon Prime, Netflix, HotStar and few other streaming apps. Not sure why Samsung doesn't give atleast a 3-4GB in a Tab in this price point whereas they are giving 6-8GB rams in there mobile of same price range. I understand the screen size and budget but atleast 3GB would have been great and I beleive it is a fair ask too.It is light, but holding for too long does cramp your hands. Doesn't has a Gorilla glass.Sound quality is OK. You feel the one sided speakers. There are two outputs at the bottom. It would have been better if they were located each either side instead. I have a JBL Go so no issues in the sound department.6000mAh battery is slightly less for a tab, 1-2K more would have been ideal.Quite a few if' are there about this Tablet, but it simply does beat all other Tabs at this price point with better features. If you are looking for a budget Tab for watching movies an series, then you can definitely go for this Tab. It will not disappoint you for sure.Have some doubts about the phisical button quality, installed alternative apps first day itself.Samsung is the best choice for electronics any day.Amazon's service was undoubtedly superb. Also got a pretty decent discount."

Welcome to 2015 with 2GB of Ram",N/A,"Spoiler Alert: This Tab can't even load two tabs in browser side by side.Build Quality: First of all build quality of this tab is good & sturdy with Metal Back & Laminated display.Display: Display quality is also good & sharp. Viewing angles are good too. SUPPORTS 10 FINGER MULTITOUCH.Sound: Stereo speakers are situated on the same side of the tab. So you won't feel any serious effect. Overall sound quality is good and loud.Connectivity & Sensor: You'll get Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, TYPE C USB port & Accelerometer. NO AUTO BRIGHTNESS SENSOR or Finger print.Camera: Don't bother about the camera of a tablet. Front camera is useless back camera is average.Internal: 23GB out of 32GB is free. Comes with some bundled bloatwares like ms office which you can't uninstall. 14nm Edynos 7904 do get its job done. But the main problems is the limited 2GB Ram. Forget about playing PUBG. it's lagging too much. The tab even failed to keep in memory two opened browser tab side by side(Amazon & Flipkart webpage) & reloads when switching between them. There should be a 3GB Ram version launched in India.Battery: Very happy about the battery backup of 6100mah battery. Battery drops only 25% on constant using(screen on time of 4hours). #Will update later.#Final verdict: Only for very basic task like media consuming & reading.If you intent to play games like PUBG or multitask, then you should forget about this. 2GB Ram is very little in 2019 standard."

User Review after one month of usage",N/A,"I was worried about the performance because of 2 gb ram, but to my utter surprise the device works fine, it knows its capacity and accordingly it manages the whole system so as to provides smooth and uninterrupted experience.  Im loving it, no lags as of now, can't say about future. I'm using everything except gaming. Payment apps can't be used without sim card so does not work on the wifi version, like paytm, Google pay etc. There are apps which might not be optimized for using in tablets and so they are not available for downloads like my jio, swiggy etc Overall evaluate the cost and benefit of having a tablet, regarding apps these are the inherent limitations of a wifi tablet, nothing to do about Samsung. Rest is quite satisfactory and definitely its value for money.UpdateAfter one month of use, still not faced any issues, except little lag when too many apps are open and try to switch between apps. Back camera serves the purpose of capturing images of documents for scanning and front camera could have been better, during video calls my video is always blur, tried using different apps like Duo, hike, whatapp etc on 4g internet, 5 mp cam of iPhone gives so clear images and video quality, little disappointing so far front cam is concerned.For reading pdf files I am using acrobat and xodo, you can highlight, underline, strikethrough, use free hand pen, add comments while reading. There are other features as well. For note taking its not much friendly as palm rejection is not supported, but it works fine otherwise. I am using ELV stylus for reading and casual marking on pdfs.The device looks premium and whoever sees it, does not belive that its price is 15000, people thinks its worth will be around 25K or 30K. Thank you samsung for the device and thank you amazon for everything."

Best in Budget",N/A,"Seeing the specifications it seemed Samsung has launched this Tab with the sole purpose of playing videos which actually was the sole need for which I was looking for a Tab. And the Tab does its job good enough that me and my friends were impressed by its performance.Not a super amoled screen, but if not kept side by side with one, it will be difficult to spot the difference for a rookie like me. Display is much much better than any other Tab in this price point. 10 inch is perfect for me. Samsung does have the best displays in its devices.2GB ram is the only drawback I see in it, however as I said its sufficient for watching videos. Good enough for Amazon Prime, Netflix, HotStar and few other streaming apps. Not sure why Samsung doesn't give atleast a 3-4GB in a Tab in this price point whereas they are giving 6-8GB rams in there mobile of same price range. I understand the screen size and budget but atleast 3GB would have been great and I beleive it is a fair ask too.It is light, but holding for too long does cramp your hands. Doesn't has a Gorilla glass.Sound quality is OK. You feel the one sided speakers. There are two outputs at the bottom. It would have been better if they were located each either side instead. I have a JBL Go so no issues in the sound department.6000mAh battery is slightly less for a tab, 1-2K more would have been ideal.Quite a few if' are there about this Tablet, but it simply does beat all other Tabs at this price point with better features. If you are looking for a budget Tab for watching movies an series, then you can definitely go for this Tab. It will not disappoint you for sure.Have some doubts about the phisical button quality, installed alternative apps first day itself.Samsung is the best choice for electronics any day.Amazon's service was undoubtedly superb. Also got a pretty decent discount."

15k couldnt get much better or can it?",N/A,"Design - for the price. Impressed with the build quality. Metal body feels premium. Minimum bezels gave this advantage over me choosing this instead of the iPad 6th gen. Watching video on this aspect is perfect. Fingerprint sensor would have made a perfect addition but not a deal breaker. The volume and power button feels nice and tactile. Easy to identify too. USB C is perfect as now tab and phone don't need two different cables. iPad loses out here too in terms of convenience. speaker is loud enough, but slight vibration in the body is felt at higher volumes. Screen isnt the greatest but its not bad. Its crisp enough for an LCD. watching videos at 1080p is good. not expecting amoled quality hereSoftware - As an android user. Using an android tablet feels easier than to use an iOS device. Google apps work great. Never used One-UI before. Quite impressed. As an Android one user with clean android likes. This seems to impress. Running on the latest version of Android also is good too with the tab in its price range compared to its competition offering older software versions.Camera- Not too impressed with it. But who uses tablets for photography. Will let it slide. For video chat it does the job. Nothing to complain.Performance - specs on paper doesn't tell the whole story. 2gb seems low but for basic tasks which the tab is meant for. its totally fine. i guess thats how they got it to be on the cheaper side. most apps load fast. i havent done any major multi tasking. but two windows side by side and a third pop up view window didnt show any lag. not saying is smooth as an ipad. you do get the occasional lags, stutters and what not. like while shifting from landscape to portrait. takes a sec to fill the window. batter life seems good for now. no complaints there. the software and ram management will take a while to understand your uses so be patient.Verdict - if you're in the Google ecosystem go for it if it's just for everyday tasks of reading, watching videos, light games, music. Does the job with ease. iPad too is great but I personally it's more in sync if you're in the apple ecosystem. If you expect high end performance don't get your hopes up. Wait and get the Tab S6. If I'd have to rate it , it would be a 4/5 . for 15k what do you expect in a tablet?"

Writing review after one month.",N/A,"‚úì Pros :‚Ä¢ Battery : Battery life is very good. It gives 12-15 hr SOT for normal usages like reading books, doing Online classes through Zoom, Watching videos on YouTube, etc‚Ä¢ Performance : I was worrying about 2GB RAM, But I am surprised.  Performance is very good for normal usages and keep 3-4 normal apps in memory easily.  Even if only 600MB free for user.‚Ä¢ Screen : Screen Quality is also good.‚Ä¢ Built Quality : Very Good, Feels like premium tablet.‚Ä¢ Updates : I got one System update (One UI 2.1) with sequrity patch and one Sequrity Patch (July 2020)‚Ä¢ USB Type C‚Ä¢ Not a Chinese OEM¬• Cons‚Ä¢ Sound : Sound quality is below the average. Dolby is just for marketing. Sound is loud but quality is bad.‚Ä¢ Charging Speed : 7.5 Watt Charge takes  about 4hr to charge from 30% to 100%‚Ä¢ Camera : Camera Quality is also very bad but for tablet it is not a deal breaker.# Overall it is very good product considering price. You should buy  this Tablet if your Budget is around ‚Çπ15k and and Sound quality of speaker is not your priority. I am satisfied with this."

Good screen, Good battery life, but slow device",N/A,"Very good media consumption device at this price range. Screen quality is very good. Excellent battery life. Nice speakers, decent camera for video calling,Most disappointing is the slow processor and RAM. With 3-4 apps open (including chrome), it becomes very slow in responding. But with 2GB ram, nothing more is expected.Good for simple usage - checking mails, viewing photos, video calls, browsing (online shopping*), news reading, media apps** etc. Definitely not multitasking even though it allows split screen - small apps would work fine.Noticed some bugs -*Amazon India app is buggy for this tablet. it already gives a notification - 'app is not optimized for this screen size'. But amazon.com works perfectly fine. I don't know if any other apps are not optimized for the tablet size.**Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube etc are fine - except Hotstar gives a white bar at the bottom(from navigation button's bar). This is so annoying for me because there is dark background in the video and then bright bar!!) .------------------------------Nevertheless this is a wonderful and sleek tablet at the price range. So, 5 stars from me. If it had 3GB ram even at Rs.1000 extra, it would become the king in the segment."

Worth every penny",N/A,"I have never been so satisfied with a gadget before.For the price, it has the best display - bright and big. Viewing angle is solid.Battery life at the beginning was good. I was getting 6-8 hours of screen on time on full charge. After 3 years, it lasts for 3-4 hours.Wi-Fi connection is good and has good internet speed for watching youtube/netflix, etc.Regular security updates. Also got one major android update. I still get security updates to this date.The two speakers at the beginning were loud and clear, but they have deteriorated over time. The loudness has also taken a huge hit. I rely on bluetooth earphones now for audio. The 3.5 mm headphone jack has stopped working completely."

Welcome to 2015 with 2GB of Ram",N/A,"Spoiler Alert: This Tab can't even load two tabs in browser side by side.Build Quality: First of all build quality of this tab is good & sturdy with Metal Back & Laminated display.Display: Display quality is also good & sharp. Viewing angles are good too. SUPPORTS 10 FINGER MULTITOUCH.Sound: Stereo speakers are situated on the same side of the tab. So you won't feel any serious effect. Overall sound quality is good and loud.Connectivity & Sensor: You'll get Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, TYPE C USB port & Accelerometer. NO AUTO BRIGHTNESS SENSOR or Finger print.Camera: Don't bother about the camera of a tablet. Front camera is useless back camera is average.Internal: 23GB out of 32GB is free. Comes with some bundled bloatwares like ms office which you can't uninstall. 14nm Edynos 7904 do get its job done. But the main problems is the limited 2GB Ram. Forget about playing PUBG. it's lagging too much. The tab even failed to keep in memory two opened browser tab side by side(Amazon & Flipkart webpage) & reloads when switching between them. There should be a 3GB Ram version launched in India.Battery: Very happy about the battery backup of 6100mah battery. Battery drops only 25% on constant using(screen on time of 4hours). #Will update later.#Final verdict: Only for very basic task like media consuming & reading.If you intent to play games like PUBG or multitask, then you should forget about this. 2GB Ram is very little in 2019 standard."

User Review after one month of usage",N/A,"I was worried about the performance because of 2 gb ram, but to my utter surprise the device works fine, it knows its capacity and accordingly it manages the whole system so as to provides smooth and uninterrupted experience.  Im loving it, no lags as of now, can't say about future. I'm using everything except gaming. Payment apps can't be used without sim card so does not work on the wifi version, like paytm, Google pay etc. There are apps which might not be optimized for using in tablets and so they are not available for downloads like my jio, swiggy etc Overall evaluate the cost and benefit of having a tablet, regarding apps these are the inherent limitations of a wifi tablet, nothing to do about Samsung. Rest is quite satisfactory and definitely its value for money.UpdateAfter one month of use, still not faced any issues, except little lag when too many apps are open and try to switch between apps. Back camera serves the purpose of capturing images of documents for scanning and front camera could have been better, during video calls my video is always blur, tried using different apps like Duo, hike, whatapp etc on 4g internet, 5 mp cam of iPhone gives so clear images and video quality, little disappointing so far front cam is concerned.For reading pdf files I am using acrobat and xodo, you can highlight, underline, strikethrough, use free hand pen, add comments while reading. There are other features as well. For note taking its not much friendly as palm rejection is not supported, but it works fine otherwise. I am using ELV stylus for reading and casual marking on pdfs.The device looks premium and whoever sees it, does not belive that its price is 15000, people thinks its worth will be around 25K or 30K. Thank you samsung for the device and thank you amazon for everything."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Best in Budget",N/A,"Seeing the specifications it seemed Samsung has launched this Tab with the sole purpose of playing videos which actually was the sole need for which I was looking for a Tab. And the Tab does its job good enough that me and my friends were impressed by its performance.Not a super amoled screen, but if not kept side by side with one, it will be difficult to spot the difference for a rookie like me. Display is much much better than any other Tab in this price point. 10 inch is perfect for me. Samsung does have the best displays in its devices.2GB ram is the only drawback I see in it, however as I said its sufficient for watching videos. Good enough for Amazon Prime, Netflix, HotStar and few other streaming apps. Not sure why Samsung doesn't give atleast a 3-4GB in a Tab in this price point whereas they are giving 6-8GB rams in there mobile of same price range. I understand the screen size and budget but atleast 3GB would have been great and I beleive it is a fair ask too.It is light, but holding for too long does cramp your hands. Doesn't has a Gorilla glass.Sound quality is OK. You feel the one sided speakers. There are two outputs at the bottom. It would have been better if they were located each either side instead. I have a JBL Go so no issues in the sound department.6000mAh battery is slightly less for a tab, 1-2K more would have been ideal.Quite a few if' are there about this Tablet, but it simply does beat all other Tabs at this price point with better features. If you are looking for a budget Tab for watching movies an series, then you can definitely go for this Tab. It will not disappoint you for sure.Have some doubts about the phisical button quality, installed alternative apps first day itself.Samsung is the best choice for electronics any day.Amazon's service was undoubtedly superb. Also got a pretty decent discount."

Very bad experience",N/A,"I bought this laptop in May 2023. After 6 months, the laptop issue started. I faced so much difficulty in getting customers' details. somehow I got their details, and they contacted me through video call and asked about the issues they told me to send the laptop to their services centre in Dehli. I had a warranty but they charged me 22050 to change the motherboard. So plz before buying the laptop think more than 10 times and then buy it."

HONOR MagicBook X14 - A Smart Choice Indeed!",N/A,"I recently upgraded to the HONOR MagicBook X14 with the 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7, and I am thoroughly impressed with this sleek and powerful laptop.

The keys are well-spaced, offering a comfortable typing experience. The backlighting is a thoughtful touch, making it easy to work in low-light conditions without sacrificing accuracy.The laptop's cooling system deserves a special mention. Even during extended use, I've noticed that it maintains a comfortable temperature, preventing any discomfort during prolonged work sessions.In terms of connectivity, the MagicBook X14 offers a good variety of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, and HDMI, providing flexibility for different devices and peripherals.In conclusion, the HONOR MagicBook X14 is, without a doubt, a smart choice.

It's a beautiful looking laptop with amazing display",N/A,After using this laptop for one day I will say if you want a compact and good looking powerful laptop it is perfect choice in this price before talking about battrey backup I will say keep it on medium performance mode and turn off gaming mode from settings which is by default turned on then it will surely give 7+ hrs of screen on time with 40% brightness and normal multitasking use it's ssd is fast it boots in 5 seconds and have a fast fingerprint sensor and it's display is amazing and colourful.

Very bad experience",N/A,"I bought this laptop in May 2023. After 6 months, the laptop issue started. I faced so much difficulty in getting customers' details. somehow I got their details, and they contacted me through video call and asked about the issues they told me to send the laptop to their services centre in Dehli. I had a warranty but they charged me 22050 to change the motherboard. So plz before buying the laptop think more than 10 times and then buy it."

Phone with Good specs but a boring OS",N/A,"I bought 6GB RAM & 128GB memory variant and this is my feedback after using for a week.I always love samsung phones but their cameras & exynos processor is this segment are their only minus. Thought of trying something different this time.As Family members are already using iQOO Z6 Pro, preferred iQOO Z7s after a long confusion of picking Oneplus Nord CE 3 Lite or iQOO Z7s and would say, its a better decision made. Guess, iQOO is now easily winning confidences from buyers in this segment.Pros:1. Light weight and evenly distributed.2. Comes with a pre-applied (very thin) glass protection and a clear TPU case.3. With 44W charger provided, 0-100% charge is happening in approx. 1 hour. 20-100% by roughly 50 mins.4. The design, especially the back. Though it is plastic, iQOO has given a very good glossy finish and especially how beautifully the back camera (s?) is placed. Go for Norway blue colour.5. Pictures taken in back camera (64MP+namesake depth sensor) are very good while selfie camera quality is above average for this segment.6. Display AMOLED with variable refreshing rates (30Hz, 60Hz, 90Hz or automatic based on usage) and in display fingerprint sensor is great and works very instantly.7. SPECS offered and their price is very good compared to other brands.8. Call quality is amazing with dual mics.9. 3.5 mm audio jack available while it is not available in Z6 pro and some other models.Cons:1. Only 6 5G bands (but should be fine with the bands operated by Jio & Airtel).2. Replacing Dimensity 920 with snapdragon 695 in the name of Z7s for same price is a scam üò°3. To reduce weight, they have given only  4500mAH battery. Moderate usage lasts 1.5 days, heavy usage (social medias) can last for a day. If you play games, consider charging again in evening. With flash charge, felt its not that bad.4. Slightly felt heating issues when used social media apps for too long.5. Single speaker at the bottom & quality is average.6. Main drawback is their OS - Funtouch. Lot of bloatwares & iQOO apps. Very annoying. Missed samsung a lot in this particular thing, Samsung experience used to feel very user friendly and secured. Not sure, will get that secured feel ever with funtouch OS. iQOO shall provide a stock android if they couldn't provide a good customized OS.If you are okay to live with Funtouch OS & a 4500mAH battery (using 5G & 4G networks drains battery quicker), this phone will never disappoint in any aspect."

Got this phone's 8/128 variant for ‚Çπ18,000.So far, I have liked the multimedia experience (majority of which is extended hours of YT videos in high definition, thanks to my YT prime membership). For me, 3 mm audio jack is a blessing. Had been missing this feature since 4 years in all my oneplus devices.Calling experience on 5G network has posed no issues so far.Battery back up is decent. Although I haven't tried any gaming yet but with the heavy social media usage, as well as long hours of video playback time, it gives me a day of uninterrupted usage.Apart from the dated water-drop notch and an average mono-speaker setup (which I barely use due to earphones), everything is quite good. Amoled display is at par. I have kept the settings on 90 Hz refresh rate.Camera is extremely good for casual day to day photography, even in low lighting conditions. An average user will not complain much. It has good in-built image editing options. Ultra-wide would have been an icing.Feel and comfort is very good and the phone is good looking. Very easy to handle for long hours due to uts light weight.The phone comes with a lot of bloatware and app suggestions. I have deleted most unwanted apps or have disabled the notifications for a few other apps which cannot be easily removed. Watch youtube video tutorials to get rid of bloatware.

Phone with Good specs but a boring OS",N/A,"I bought 6GB RAM & 128GB memory variant and this is my feedback after using for a week.I always love samsung phones but their cameras & exynos processor is this segment are their only minus. Thought of trying something different this time.As Family members are already using iQOO Z6 Pro, preferred iQOO Z7s after a long confusion of picking Oneplus Nord CE 3 Lite or iQOO Z7s and would say, its a better decision made. Guess, iQOO is now easily winning confidences from buyers in this segment.Pros:1. Light weight and evenly distributed.2. Comes with a pre-applied (very thin) glass protection and a clear TPU case.3. With 44W charger provided, 0-100% charge is happening in approx. 1 hour. 20-100% by roughly 50 mins.4. The design, especially the back. Though it is plastic, iQOO has given a very good glossy finish and especially how beautifully the back camera (s?) is placed. Go for Norway blue colour.5. Pictures taken in back camera (64MP+namesake depth sensor) are very good while selfie camera quality is above average for this segment.6. Display AMOLED with variable refreshing rates (30Hz, 60Hz, 90Hz or automatic based on usage) and in display fingerprint sensor is great and works very instantly.7. SPECS offered and their price is very good compared to other brands.8. Call quality is amazing with dual mics.9. 3.5 mm audio jack available while it is not available in Z6 pro and some other models.Cons:1. Only 6 5G bands (but should be fine with the bands operated by Jio & Airtel).2. Replacing Dimensity 920 with snapdragon 695 in the name of Z7s for same price is a scam üò°3. To reduce weight, they have given only  4500mAH battery. Moderate usage lasts 1.5 days, heavy usage (social medias) can last for a day. If you play games, consider charging again in evening. With flash charge, felt its not that bad.4. Slightly felt heating issues when used social media apps for too long.5. Single speaker at the bottom & quality is average.6. Main drawback is their OS - Funtouch. Lot of bloatwares & iQOO apps. Very annoying. Missed samsung a lot in this particular thing, Samsung experience used to feel very user friendly and secured. Not sure, will get that secured feel ever with funtouch OS. iQOO shall provide a stock android if they couldn't provide a good customized OS.If you are okay to live with Funtouch OS & a 4500mAH battery (using 5G & 4G networks drains battery quicker), this phone will never disappoint in any aspect."

Promising.",N/A,"Lot to like given the price point. Got this phone's 8/128 variant for ‚Çπ18,000.So far, I have liked the multimedia experience (majority of which is extended hours of YT videos in high definition, thanks to my YT prime membership). For me, 3 mm audio jack is a blessing. Had been missing this feature since 4 years in all my oneplus devices.Calling experience on 5G network has posed no issues so far.Battery back up is decent. Although I haven't tried any gaming yet but with the heavy social media usage, as well as long hours of video playback time, it gives me a day of uninterrupted usage.Apart from the dated water-drop notch and an average mono-speaker setup (which I barely use due to earphones), everything is quite good. Amoled display is at par. I have kept the settings on 90 Hz refresh rate.Camera is extremely good for casual day to day photography, even in low lighting conditions. An average user will not complain much. It has good in-built image editing options. Ultra-wide would have been an icing.Feel and comfort is very good and the phone is good looking. Very easy to handle for long hours due to uts light weight.The phone comes with a lot of bloatware and app suggestions. I have deleted most unwanted apps or have disabled the notifications for a few other apps which cannot be easily removed. Watch youtube video tutorials to get rid of bloatware. Now, I'm able to get a clean software experience.I hope that it turns out to be a durable device and Iqoo is able to deliver all promised updates in a timely manner."

A Concise Appraisal for Discerning Consumers",N/A,"I procured the Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse, boasting a 2.4 GHz connectivity and USB Nano Receiver, approximately 1.5 years ago.

Small, not too heavy, good looking.",N/A,"Hi guys! Bought this yesterday, so haven‚Äôt used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me."

Value for Money",N/A,"I recently purchased the Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse and have been using it for a few months now. I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with this mouse. First of all, the wireless feature is a game changer. No more tangled cords or limited movement due to short cord length. The 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any lag or connectivity issues. The USB Nano Receiver is also a great addition. It is so small and barely noticeable when plugged into my laptop. It does not block any other USB ports, which is a common issue with other wireless mice. The receiver also has a storage compartment in the mouse, which is a convenient feature for travel.Pros: Value for moneyHandyGood connectivityCons: Scroll does not work smoothly after a few months of using"

Good while working but starts to have problems",N/A,"I bought this back in April 2021 and liked it a lot because of the smooth operation. The mouse is a bit small and needs some getting used to initially. After about 6 months, I started to have problems with the scroll and then the right click stopped working too. So I had to contact the Logitech Support and after some troubleshooting they told me to take it to their service center which was an hour's drive from my place. They took the mouse back and said they will let me know when they get replacements. I had to go back another day to pick it up. The new one again worked fine for a few months but the scroll button failed after a few months. Looks like a lot of customers are having the scroll button issue. May be it needs to be redesigned to eliminate this issue. Logitech please note."

It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me."

Value for Money",N/A,"I recently purchased the Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse and have been using it for a few months now. I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with this mouse. First of all, the wireless feature is a game changer. No more tangled cords or limited movement due to short cord length. The 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any lag or connectivity issues. The USB Nano Receiver is also a great addition. It is so small and barely noticeable when plugged into my laptop. It does not block any other USB ports, which is a common issue with other wireless mice. The receiver also has a storage compartment in the mouse, which is a convenient feature for travel.Pros: Value for moneyHandyGood connectivityCons: Scroll does not work smoothly after a few months of using"

Good while working but starts to have problems",N/A,"I bought this back in April 2021 and liked it a lot because of the smooth operation. The mouse is a bit small and needs some getting used to initially. After about 6 months, I started to have problems with the scroll and then the right click stopped working too. So I had to contact the Logitech Support and after some troubleshooting they told me to take it to their service center which was an hour's drive from my place. They took the mouse back and said they will let me know when they get replacements. I had to go back another day to pick it up. The new one again worked fine for a few months but the scroll button failed after a few months. Looks like a lot of customers are having the scroll button issue. May be it needs to be redesigned to eliminate this issue. Logitech please note."

And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me."

Value for Money",N/A,"I recently purchased the Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse and have been using it for a few months now. I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with this mouse. First of all, the wireless feature is a game changer. No more tangled cords or limited movement due to short cord length. The 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any lag or connectivity issues. The USB Nano Receiver is also a great addition. It is so small and barely noticeable when plugged into my laptop. It does not block any other USB ports, which is a common issue with other wireless mice. The receiver also has a storage compartment in the mouse, which is a convenient feature for travel.Pros: Value for moneyHandyGood connectivityCons: Scroll does not work smoothly after a few months of using"

Good while working but starts to have problems",N/A,"I bought this back in April 2021 and liked it a lot because of the smooth operation. The mouse is a bit small and needs some getting used to initially. After about 6 months, I started to have problems with the scroll and then the right click stopped working too. So I had to contact the Logitech Support and after some troubleshooting they told me to take it to their service center which was an hour's drive from my place. They took the mouse back and said they will let me know when they get replacements. I had to go back another day to pick it up. The new one again worked fine for a few months but the scroll button failed after a few months. Looks like a lot of customers are having the scroll button issue. May be it needs to be redesigned to eliminate this issue. Logitech please note."

Sound quality is average, but I have a higher end computer whose sound is also comparable, so honestly this is good for this price range. We got this for about 51k during the Diwali sale, its perfect for home use, though I did carry it a couple of times outside on work and it was fine in my large leather bag. This is our first Asus computer and so far so good, will write a review after using it for more time."

There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB.3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet.4.

Sound quality is average, but I have a higher end computer whose sound is also comparable, so honestly this is good for this price range. We got this for about 51k during the Diwali sale, its perfect for home use, though I did carry it a couple of times outside on work and it was fine in my large leather bag. This is our first Asus computer and so far so good, will write a review after using it for more time."

Review after one month of usage1.BODY : is long durable, military grade built is showing its stiffness , built by high quality plastic fibre, Dc e-shock proof bcz of non metallic.2.LOOK :Looking marvelous, slim & slick design, light weight in 16"" category, quiet blue colour looking decent and colour will not fade with time.3.PERFORMANCE : is on the top of the things which is to be considered, very less boot time (09 sec),file transfer is fast, quick response , even it have no dedicated graphics still it play gta v at full resolution without any lag (40fps), can outrun any processor of its category. H-series is running like a racing horse, when u give it heavy task, processor boost its frequency and initiate hyper threading.4.BATTERY :backup depends upon how you use, with hardcore gaming it gives 4+ hour of backup, normal tasking with 50% brightness gives you 7+ hour of backup.5. FEATURES :#Wuxga screen gives u richness in colour but lack behind of Oled (but manageable due to very less price),still better than lcd & lft & tft.#Camera privacy have both option shut off by key with LED indicator and shutoff by physical shutter.#Mic privacy shutter is given by key with led indicator. It is a good decision taken by asus for nowdays need,.#180¬∞ hinge is additional things but u will not use it often unless u have to share something on the table. Still good thing for future proof & it also save u from hinge damage by excess elongation,#Fingerprint sensor is very fast, ultra responsive and read ur fingerprint very accurately. Something about 0.2 second it takes#Camera is average not good not bad but decent#TouchPad is big enough and multitouch sensor with best interactive pad.#Charging is fast as needed(roughly it takes 1 hour)Key Backlit gives u 3 mode brightness have blue-whitish glow.#Cooling system is efficient, it ON when heavy task is executed, bluetooth wifi is awesome with latest technology as today it provide.#Light in weight 1.8 kg, slim design.@Overall everything is good.Considering Price & value it is 100% recommended.Thankyou amazon for fast delivery (within 2 day) , and asus for a wonderful product."

Value for money Laptop from Asus",N/A,"Likes :Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell.Dislike :It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot.Some points to clear confusion:1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future.* There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted.2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB.3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet.4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm.5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too.6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise.7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off.*The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones.If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop.I hope this helps."

Amazing Product",N/A,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13."

Exceeding my expectation. Go for it.",N/A,"About the phoneApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition.

Amazing Product",N/A,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13."

Best Budget Tablet In The Segment",N/A,"When it comes to budget tablets the choices are very less since no one except brand like Apple took this category to the next level. With that the prices went up as well and it made even harder for normal users to even consider using those devices and this is where Samsung totally nailed it.Now, I know the specification may not look that attractive but you need to ask ask yourself few following questions-No 1. Do you own a decent phone?No 2. Are you looing for something which can be used for video, media consumption?no 3. Are you low on budget?If all your answers are YES then you are looking at the right product. Let me tell you one thing don't have any high expectations like doing intensive task , playing games etc. Whatever specification is provided is more then adequate for your daily activities. However, I did face some occasional frizz while using chrome on desktop mode but it gets the job done. I would have loved to see if Samsung provided better optimization for tabs like this. I have zero complains for it's hardware. It feels extremely well build. It has a modern look to it. The best part has to be it's display. Samsung has always been winner in this part. Even though it has an LCD display. Trust me you will not regrade it. In hand feeling is quite premium. The best thing about the tab is the aspect ratio. I have seen others using bigger and expensive tabs. Whenever I see them playing a video there is a thick black border which takes away the experience of having a high resolution big screen. In this tab it's quite minimal plus most videos plays full screen. It has a support for widevine l1. with quad speaker and superb battery. It takes the experience to the next level. Trust me when you buy this it will surely put a smile on your face. back camera is okyish. Nothing much to talk about. I don't thing the processor and RAM is a deal breaker anyway since we are talking about a TAB.So, Do I recommend it?The answer is obvious and a big YES. Totally value for money. Just go for it. .Wrote everything after using the tab personally for long time which puts me in a situation of writing this. Thank you..Lastly, Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. You have done phenomenal job in this covid situation.  Thank you.."

It's entry level tab, don't expect too much...",N/A,"I bought it for my wife & kids for ‚Çπ15499 after discount. It's entry level tab which you can use mainly for consumption, e.g. reading Google Docs, PDFs, Classroom, email, watching YouTube, Zoom, hotstar, Amazon, etc.PRO:- Cheap, affordable.- Sound quality is better than my iPad as it has 4 speakers. It claims it supports Dolby Atmos! I didn't test yet.- Supports fast charging, but poor quality charger provided. Use better charger.- Supports SD cards & 3.5 mm headphone jack, though I found SD card is only for personal file storage.- Front camera position.- Display quality & camera are Ok-ish for the price.CONS:- Given charger is bad, it will take 4-5 hrs to get 100% charge. I use more powerful charger from Galaxy Phone or iPhone/iPad as it supports Fast Charging.- With just 3GB RAM you shouldn't play games. Buy iPad 8 or Air for that.- 32 GB storage is too low. You can't install many apps or add many users.- You can't install or move apps to SD cards. I tried, but it's blocked for all the apps I use.- You cannot merge internal 32 GB memory with SD card. I tried with 128 GB SanDisk card, but there is no option to add or merge memory during format, which is supported in other Android devices.  I think Sammy did this on purpose, just to protect sales of high end devices.- Adaptive Brightness is useless. Hope they fix it in future update.Overall, I'd give 4/5 for the price vis-a-vis feature. If it lasts 3 years, I'm good."

Perfect tablet for me",N/A,"An awesome tablet that is fully bang for your buck.Pros:Gorgeous slim design and metal + glass build which gives a very premium feel.SD card slot for extra storage.Headphone jack for people who have lots wired headphone and also to connect other audio accessories to tablet.4 speakers that sounds awesome. Don't need extranal speakers while watching videos. Once you get used to 4 speakers you don't want to go back.Supports Samsung's fast charge.You can install Gcam on this tab. ;)Cons:Display has stong blue tint, which can be fixed by using built in blue light filter but still color calibration could've been better.Display is crisp but colors are bit dull.Ram should've been atleast 4gb instead of 3gb.8mp +5mp camera setup is just way too outdated. Minimum should be 12mp + 8mp camera setup.No fast charger in box.Is this a best tablet? ""No"" but it isn't a bad one either. If we compare this tab on its price tag vs features it just blows its compition out of water. I wish they had given atleast slightly better screen but that doesn't mean the screen is that bad.This tablet is good for those looking for video watching, zoom meetings, online studies, email, document edits, ebook reading, etc. like work then this is a solid device. However gamers and hardcore users may be disappointed.For me personally as per my non gaming usage this tab is just perfect so 5 stars."

A Great Deal To Catch",N/A,"Very decent design tab with bright screen visible in outdoor also, touch response is very nice, camera front and back is normal, image quality is not so good but decent in this price point, sound output is best in this price range, battery backup of tab is not so good but last upto 3 hours in continuous video playback, processing speed is decent no lag is there in usage for daily tasks. Built is best as it belongs to samsung. Definitely buy it."

Price worthy!",N/A,"Got for 14,500 so will review according to this price.On hands it does have a premium feel.Display is good but I can see a yellow tint at one edge of screen when on full brightness, but not seen in dark mode. Don't know whether to exchange or get adjusted with this!Speakers are just awesome. They are beyond any competition at this price point.Samsung UI has some nice features like split screen, screen pinning, app pop up view etc.Battery charging time is around 3 hrs 30 mins with the given 7.5watt charger. Backup isn't that great, can last for about 8-10 hrs with moderate usage.Gaming not tried and not interested too but small games may be butter smooth.For light use of mine haven't faced any lags also with multiple apps open in background.I somehow feel like sd662 will become laggy offlate.some reviews mentioned prepladder and marrow aren't working... I've tried it and found Prepladder video just lags sometimes and you may not like to use it. But Marrow is working fine, even at 1.2x the video plays well(PS: just tried 2 videos).PDF reading experience is excellent.Front and back cams are ok for this price point.So who should buy?-People needing tab for media consumption-For E-book reading-For online lecturesTo summarize: ""This is a great value for money tab, at this price. I don't think there is any competion for this one and the next best tab is Ipad which is around 14000 more than this""So, choice is yours! üòâ"

Best Product at this Price Range",N/A,"I have been using this tablet for the last  2-3 days and I am pretty impressed with the product.Design & Build Quality :Design and Build Quality is very nice of this tablet. It is around 470 grams but when you carry in your hand it doesn't feel very heavy.Screen Quality:Though it has an IPS display the screen quality is pretty good. It has a very sharp color and brightness is also good. You can definitely enjoy watching videos in this tablet.Sound:The biggest advantage of this tablet is its 4 speakers. It produces a very nice sound output. It is loud enough to enjoy movies without any external Bluetooth speaker. It also supports Dolby audio so you will definitely enjoy the sound of this tablet.Camera Quality:It has an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. I am not impressed with the camera quality. For video calls, it is okay but doesn't expect that it will take photos like your smart phones.UI Experience:It comes with Android 10 and One UI 2.5. It's a very neat and clean UI with No bloatware. It comes with some pre-installed application but you can able to uninstall or disable it.Cons :I have found only cons in this tablet that it supports 15-watt fast charging but in the box, you will only get a 7.5-watt charger, so if you want to charge your tablet faster then you have to purchase a new 15-watt charger or any other mobile phone fast charger. In my case, I am using an 18-watt fast charger of Redmi."

It won't put a smile on your face, but it will do the job.",N/A,"I wanted a tab for studying from pdfs, watching videos and attending zoom meetings. Those three jobs it will do perfectly well. It will not multitask though, and if you are going to be spending a lot of time on chrome, browsing internet, you will start seeing lag. But for pdfs, videos and lectures you can buy it.Performance while using:1. CHROME: Definitely lags a little bit while browsing.2. READING PDFS: Crisp and smooth. Use ReadEra app for an amazing experience.3. YOUTUBE: Nice and smooth, no stutter, no lag.4. AUDIO: As others have mentioned, it is loud enough and good.5. DISPLAY: Strictly average. We have 5 phones in our family, from low range to mid range. All of them have better display than this.6. SWITCHING APPS: You will definitely notice the lag here. So you must know your usage. Are you using it for browsing facebook, chrome etc? Or for watching videos, pdfs etc.Not tried yet:1. VIDEO CALL: Will update.Bottom line is this is no Ferrari. If you are like me, and the only 4 apps you need are : ReadEra, Youtube, VLC and Zoom, this tab is good enough for you, you can buy it. But if you are going to use it like a phone - switching apps like crazy, scrolling infinitely etc. it won't work for you. You can buy the 32 GB ipad for that. It is not priced too far (26,000 vs 17,000).Personally, I am satisfied with the performance because I was not expecting much. One thing I am sorely disappointed with is the display quality. Expected much better from Samsung, which is known for its AMOLED displays."

THE Best Tablet under 20K",N/A,"Got the Wifi variant of the tablet. I was looking for a device which would help in:1) Casual tasks like email checking2) Documents reading3) Media consumption (very much)The tab just serves all my purpose and I am totally satisfied with it. The day to day tasks feel smooth and fast (one suggestion to make it feel more quicker is reduce the animations to 0.5x in the developer mode).The screen is good not the best one, viewing angles could have been better but again can't complain at the price point. Brightness though could have been more as the current high settings is okish for outdoor usage.The Speakers are AMAZING, can definitely feel the stereo audio output. The Dolby surround is too good, its a treat to watch media in this tablet.Performance is sufficient for my usage. Fortunately a Snapdragon processor is given and not the crappy Exynos, the former is better in all terms. 3 GB RAM is OK, but Samsung should have given 4GB. With around 1.5GB available memory we can multi task with 2/3 apps but not more. NOTE - This is not a gaming tablet, I tested COD mobile and works at high settings with smooth frame rates, but PUBG runs only at lower settings and can feel the stutter sometimes. Demanding games cannot run at higher FPS, if you are planning for casual games then go for it.Battery & Charging - While it does support fast charging, the provided charger (5V at 1.5 A) takes AGES to charge fully. Battery backup is good but not the best, it could have been given with atleast 8-9K mAH battery. NOTE - To extend batteries health and life, Samsung has given inbuilt settings to limit charge to 85%. While this will reduce the total capacity of the charge, the impact it has on the health is best.Camera - The fron facing 5mp camera is decent and serves the purpose for video calling and meetings. The back camera however is PATHETIC, don't even think of taking pictures with it rather use your mobile phone.Case/Cover - I bought the Tukzer Case Cover and its the BEST. Its soft to touch and give premium feel, has correct fitting with proper cutouts for buttons. Highly recommend this case.Conclusion:I will totally recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a tablet under 20K as there is not comparison for this in the price range."

Price worthy!",N/A,"Got for 14,500 so will review according to this price.On hands it does have a premium feel.Display is good but I can see a yellow tint at one edge of screen when on full brightness, but not seen in dark mode. Don't know whether to exchange or get adjusted with this!Speakers are just awesome. They are beyond any competition at this price point.Samsung UI has some nice features like split screen, screen pinning, app pop up view etc.Battery charging time is around 3 hrs 30 mins with the given 7.5watt charger. Backup isn't that great, can last for about 8-10 hrs with moderate usage.Gaming not tried and not interested too but small games may be butter smooth.For light use of mine haven't faced any lags also with multiple apps open in background.I somehow feel like sd662 will become laggy offlate.some reviews mentioned prepladder and marrow aren't working... I've tried it and found Prepladder video just lags sometimes and you may not like to use it. But Marrow is working fine, even at 1.2x the video plays well(PS: just tried 2 videos).PDF reading experience is excellent.Front and back cams are ok for this price point.So who should buy?-People needing tab for media consumption-For E-book reading-For online lecturesTo summarize: ""This is a great value for money tab, at this price. I don't think there is any competion for this one and the next best tab is Ipad which is around 14000 more than this""So, choice is yours! üòâ"

Best Product at this Price Range",N/A,"I have been using this tablet for the last  2-3 days and I am pretty impressed with the product.Design & Build Quality :Design and Build Quality is very nice of this tablet. It is around 470 grams but when you carry in your hand it doesn't feel very heavy.Screen Quality:Though it has an IPS display the screen quality is pretty good. It has a very sharp color and brightness is also good. You can definitely enjoy watching videos in this tablet.Sound:The biggest advantage of this tablet is its 4 speakers. It produces a very nice sound output. It is loud enough to enjoy movies without any external Bluetooth speaker. It also supports Dolby audio so you will definitely enjoy the sound of this tablet.Camera Quality:It has an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. I am not impressed with the camera quality. For video calls, it is okay but doesn't expect that it will take photos like your smart phones.UI Experience:It comes with Android 10 and One UI 2.5. It's a very neat and clean UI with No bloatware. It comes with some pre-installed application but you can able to uninstall or disable it.Cons :I have found only cons in this tablet that it supports 15-watt fast charging but in the box, you will only get a 7.5-watt charger, so if you want to charge your tablet faster then you have to purchase a new 15-watt charger or any other mobile phone fast charger. In my case, I am using an 18-watt fast charger of Redmi."

It won't put a smile on your face, but it will do the job.",N/A,"I wanted a tab for studying from pdfs, watching videos and attending zoom meetings. Those three jobs it will do perfectly well. It will not multitask though, and if you are going to be spending a lot of time on chrome, browsing internet, you will start seeing lag. But for pdfs, videos and lectures you can buy it.Performance while using:1. CHROME: Definitely lags a little bit while browsing.2. READING PDFS: Crisp and smooth. Use ReadEra app for an amazing experience.3. YOUTUBE: Nice and smooth, no stutter, no lag.4. AUDIO: As others have mentioned, it is loud enough and good.5. DISPLAY: Strictly average. We have 5 phones in our family, from low range to mid range. All of them have better display than this.6. SWITCHING APPS: You will definitely notice the lag here. So you must know your usage. Are you using it for browsing facebook, chrome etc? Or for watching videos, pdfs etc.Not tried yet:1. VIDEO CALL: Will update.Bottom line is this is no Ferrari. If you are like me, and the only 4 apps you need are : ReadEra, Youtube, VLC and Zoom, this tab is good enough for you, you can buy it. But if you are going to use it like a phone - switching apps like crazy, scrolling infinitely etc. it won't work for you. You can buy the 32 GB ipad for that. It is not priced too far (26,000 vs 17,000).Personally, I am satisfied with the performance because I was not expecting much. One thing I am sorely disappointed with is the display quality. Expected much better from Samsung, which is known for its AMOLED displays."

THE Best Tablet under 20K",N/A,"Got the Wifi variant of the tablet. I was looking for a device which would help in:1) Casual tasks like email checking2) Documents reading3) Media consumption (very much)The tab just serves all my purpose and I am totally satisfied with it. The day to day tasks feel smooth and fast (one suggestion to make it feel more quicker is reduce the animations to 0.5x in the developer mode).The screen is good not the best one, viewing angles could have been better but again can't complain at the price point. Brightness though could have been more as the current high settings is okish for outdoor usage.The Speakers are AMAZING, can definitely feel the stereo audio output. The Dolby surround is too good, its a treat to watch media in this tablet.Performance is sufficient for my usage. Fortunately a Snapdragon processor is given and not the crappy Exynos, the former is better in all terms. 3 GB RAM is OK, but Samsung should have given 4GB. With around 1.5GB available memory we can multi task with 2/3 apps but not more. NOTE - This is not a gaming tablet, I tested COD mobile and works at high settings with smooth frame rates, but PUBG runs only at lower settings and can feel the stutter sometimes. Demanding games cannot run at higher FPS, if you are planning for casual games then go for it.Battery & Charging - While it does support fast charging, the provided charger (5V at 1.5 A) takes AGES to charge fully. Battery backup is good but not the best, it could have been given with atleast 8-9K mAH battery. NOTE - To extend batteries health and life, Samsung has given inbuilt settings to limit charge to 85%. While this will reduce the total capacity of the charge, the impact it has on the health is best.Camera - The fron facing 5mp camera is decent and serves the purpose for video calling and meetings. The back camera however is PATHETIC, don't even think of taking pictures with it rather use your mobile phone.Case/Cover - I bought the Tukzer Case Cover and its the BEST. Its soft to touch and give premium feel, has correct fitting with proper cutouts for buttons. Highly recommend this case.Conclusion:I will totally recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a tablet under 20K as there is not comparison for this in the price range."

Best Budget Tablet In The Segment",N/A,"When it comes to budget tablets the choices are very less since no one except brand like Apple took this category to the next level. With that the prices went up as well and it made even harder for normal users to even consider using those devices and this is where Samsung totally nailed it.Now, I know the specification may not look that attractive but you need to ask ask yourself few following questions-No 1. Do you own a decent phone?No 2. Are you looing for something which can be used for video, media consumption?no 3. Are you low on budget?If all your answers are YES then you are looking at the right product. Let me tell you one thing don't have any high expectations like doing intensive task , playing games etc. Whatever specification is provided is more then adequate for your daily activities. However, I did face some occasional frizz while using chrome on desktop mode but it gets the job done. I would have loved to see if Samsung provided better optimization for tabs like this. I have zero complains for it's hardware. It feels extremely well build. It has a modern look to it. The best part has to be it's display. Samsung has always been winner in this part. Even though it has an LCD display. Trust me you will not regrade it. In hand feeling is quite premium. The best thing about the tab is the aspect ratio. I have seen others using bigger and expensive tabs. Whenever I see them playing a video there is a thick black border which takes away the experience of having a high resolution big screen. In this tab it's quite minimal plus most videos plays full screen. It has a support for widevine l1. with quad speaker and superb battery. It takes the experience to the next level. Trust me when you buy this it will surely put a smile on your face. back camera is okyish. Nothing much to talk about. I don't thing the processor and RAM is a deal breaker anyway since we are talking about a TAB.So, Do I recommend it?The answer is obvious and a big YES. Totally value for money. Just go for it. .Wrote everything after using the tab personally for long time which puts me in a situation of writing this. Thank you..Lastly, Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. You have done phenomenal job in this covid situation.  Thank you.."

It's entry level tab, don't expect too much...",N/A,"I bought it for my wife & kids for ‚Çπ15499 after discount. It's entry level tab which you can use mainly for consumption, e.g. reading Google Docs, PDFs, Classroom, email, watching YouTube, Zoom, hotstar, Amazon, etc.PRO:- Cheap, affordable.- Sound quality is better than my iPad as it has 4 speakers. It claims it supports Dolby Atmos! I didn't test yet.- Supports fast charging, but poor quality charger provided. Use better charger.- Supports SD cards & 3.5 mm headphone jack, though I found SD card is only for personal file storage.- Front camera position.- Display quality & camera are Ok-ish for the price.CONS:- Given charger is bad, it will take 4-5 hrs to get 100% charge. I use more powerful charger from Galaxy Phone or iPhone/iPad as it supports Fast Charging.- With just 3GB RAM you shouldn't play games. Buy iPad 8 or Air for that.- 32 GB storage is too low. You can't install many apps or add many users.- You can't install or move apps to SD cards. I tried, but it's blocked for all the apps I use.- You cannot merge internal 32 GB memory with SD card. I tried with 128 GB SanDisk card, but there is no option to add or merge memory during format, which is supported in other Android devices.  I think Sammy did this on purpose, just to protect sales of high end devices.- Adaptive Brightness is useless. Hope they fix it in future update.Overall, I'd give 4/5 for the price vis-a-vis feature. If it lasts 3 years, I'm good."

Perfect tablet for me",N/A,"An awesome tablet that is fully bang for your buck.Pros:Gorgeous slim design and metal + glass build which gives a very premium feel.SD card slot for extra storage.Headphone jack for people who have lots wired headphone and also to connect other audio accessories to tablet.4 speakers that sounds awesome. Don't need extranal speakers while watching videos. Once you get used to 4 speakers you don't want to go back.Supports Samsung's fast charge.You can install Gcam on this tab. ;)Cons:Display has stong blue tint, which can be fixed by using built in blue light filter but still color calibration could've been better.Display is crisp but colors are bit dull.Ram should've been atleast 4gb instead of 3gb.8mp +5mp camera setup is just way too outdated. Minimum should be 12mp + 8mp camera setup.No fast charger in box.Is this a best tablet? ""No"" but it isn't a bad one either. If we compare this tab on its price tag vs features it just blows its compition out of water. I wish they had given atleast slightly better screen but that doesn't mean the screen is that bad.This tablet is good for those looking for video watching, zoom meetings, online studies, email, document edits, ebook reading, etc. like work then this is a solid device. However gamers and hardcore users may be disappointed.For me personally as per my non gaming usage this tab is just perfect so 5 stars."

Fortunately a Snapdragon processor is given and not the crappy Exynos, the former is better in all terms. 3 GB RAM is OK, but Samsung should have given 4GB. With around 1.5GB available memory we can multi task with 2/3 apps but not more. NOTE - This is not a gaming tablet, I tested COD mobile and works at high settings with smooth frame rates, but PUBG runs only at lower settings and can feel the stutter sometimes. Demanding games cannot run at higher FPS, if you are planning for casual games then go for it.Battery & Charging - While it does support fast charging, the provided charger (5V at 1.5 A) takes AGES to charge fully. Battery backup is good but not the best, it could have been given with atleast 8-9K mAH battery. NOTE - To extend batteries health and life, Samsung has given inbuilt settings to limit charge to 85%. While this will reduce the total capacity of the charge, the impact it has on the health is best.Camera - The fron facing 5mp camera is decent and serves the purpose for video calling and meetings. The back camera however is PATHETIC, don't even think of taking pictures with it rather use your mobile phone.Case/Cover - I bought the Tukzer Case Cover and its the BEST. Its soft to touch and give premium feel, has correct fitting with proper cutouts for buttons. Highly recommend this case.Conclusion:I will totally recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a tablet under 20K as there is not comparison for this in the price range."

Best Budget Tablet In The Segment",N/A,"When it comes to budget tablets the choices are very less since no one except brand like Apple took this category to the next level. With that the prices went up as well and it made even harder for normal users to even consider using those devices and this is where Samsung totally nailed it.Now, I know the specification may not look that attractive but you need to ask ask yourself few following questions-No 1. Do you own a decent phone?No 2. Are you looing for something which can be used for video, media consumption?no 3. Are you low on budget?If all your answers are YES then you are looking at the right product. Let me tell you one thing don't have any high expectations like doing intensive task , playing games etc. Whatever specification is provided is more then adequate for your daily activities. However, I did face some occasional frizz while using chrome on desktop mode but it gets the job done. I would have loved to see if Samsung provided better optimization for tabs like this. I have zero complains for it's hardware. It feels extremely well build. It has a modern look to it. The best part has to be it's display. Samsung has always been winner in this part. Even though it has an LCD display. Trust me you will not regrade it. In hand feeling is quite premium. The best thing about the tab is the aspect ratio. I have seen others using bigger and expensive tabs. Whenever I see them playing a video there is a thick black border which takes away the experience of having a high resolution big screen. In this tab it's quite minimal plus most videos plays full screen. It has a support for widevine l1. with quad speaker and superb battery. It takes the experience to the next level. Trust me when you buy this it will surely put a smile on your face. back camera is okyish. Nothing much to talk about. I don't thing the processor and RAM is a deal breaker anyway since we are talking about a TAB.So, Do I recommend it?The answer is obvious and a big YES. Totally value for money. Just go for it. .Wrote everything after using the tab personally for long time which puts me in a situation of writing this. Thank you..Lastly, Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. You have done phenomenal job in this covid situation.  Thank you.."

It's entry level tab, don't expect too much...",N/A,"I bought it for my wife & kids for ‚Çπ15499 after discount. It's entry level tab which you can use mainly for consumption, e.g. reading Google Docs, PDFs, Classroom, email, watching YouTube, Zoom, hotstar, Amazon, etc.PRO:- Cheap, affordable.- Sound quality is better than my iPad as it has 4 speakers. It claims it supports Dolby Atmos! I didn't test yet.- Supports fast charging, but poor quality charger provided. Use better charger.- Supports SD cards & 3.5 mm headphone jack, though I found SD card is only for personal file storage.- Front camera position.- Display quality & camera are Ok-ish for the price.CONS:- Given charger is bad, it will take 4-5 hrs to get 100% charge. I use more powerful charger from Galaxy Phone or iPhone/iPad as it supports Fast Charging.- With just 3GB RAM you shouldn't play games. Buy iPad 8 or Air for that.- 32 GB storage is too low. You can't install many apps or add many users.- You can't install or move apps to SD cards. I tried, but it's blocked for all the apps I use.- You cannot merge internal 32 GB memory with SD card. I tried with 128 GB SanDisk card, but there is no option to add or merge memory during format, which is supported in other Android devices.  I think Sammy did this on purpose, just to protect sales of high end devices.- Adaptive Brightness is useless. Hope they fix it in future update.Overall, I'd give 4/5 for the price vis-a-vis feature. If it lasts 3 years, I'm good."

Perfect tablet for me",N/A,"An awesome tablet that is fully bang for your buck.Pros:Gorgeous slim design and metal + glass build which gives a very premium feel.SD card slot for extra storage.Headphone jack for people who have lots wired headphone and also to connect other audio accessories to tablet.4 speakers that sounds awesome. Don't need extranal speakers while watching videos. Once you get used to 4 speakers you don't want to go back.Supports Samsung's fast charge.You can install Gcam on this tab. ;)Cons:Display has stong blue tint, which can be fixed by using built in blue light filter but still color calibration could've been better.Display is crisp but colors are bit dull.Ram should've been atleast 4gb instead of 3gb.8mp +5mp camera setup is just way too outdated. Minimum should be 12mp + 8mp camera setup.No fast charger in box.Is this a best tablet? ""No"" but it isn't a bad one either. If we compare this tab on its price tag vs features it just blows its compition out of water. I wish they had given atleast slightly better screen but that doesn't mean the screen is that bad.This tablet is good for those looking for video watching, zoom meetings, online studies, email, document edits, ebook reading, etc. like work then this is a solid device. However gamers and hardcore users may be disappointed.For me personally as per my non gaming usage this tab is just perfect so 5 stars."

A Great Deal To Catch",N/A,"Very decent design tab with bright screen visible in outdoor also, touch response is very nice, camera front and back is normal, image quality is not so good but decent in this price point, sound output is best in this price range, battery backup of tab is not so good but last upto 3 hours in continuous video playback, processing speed is decent no lag is there in usage for daily tasks. Built is best as it belongs to samsung. Definitely buy it."

Price worthy!",N/A,"Got for 14,500 so will review according to this price.On hands it does have a premium feel.Display is good but I can see a yellow tint at one edge of screen when on full brightness, but not seen in dark mode. Don't know whether to exchange or get adjusted with this!Speakers are just awesome. They are beyond any competition at this price point.Samsung UI has some nice features like split screen, screen pinning, app pop up view etc.Battery charging time is around 3 hrs 30 mins with the given 7.5watt charger. Backup isn't that great, can last for about 8-10 hrs with moderate usage.Gaming not tried and not interested too but small games may be butter smooth.For light use of mine haven't faced any lags also with multiple apps open in background.I somehow feel like sd662 will become laggy offlate.some reviews mentioned prepladder and marrow aren't working... I've tried it and found Prepladder video just lags sometimes and you may not like to use it. But Marrow is working fine, even at 1.2x the video plays well(PS: just tried 2 videos).PDF reading experience is excellent.Front and back cams are ok for this price point.So who should buy?-People needing tab for media consumption-For E-book reading-For online lecturesTo summarize: ""This is a great value for money tab, at this price. I don't think there is any competion for this one and the next best tab is Ipad which is around 14000 more than this""So, choice is yours! üòâ"

Best Product at this Price Range",N/A,"I have been using this tablet for the last  2-3 days and I am pretty impressed with the product.Design & Build Quality :Design and Build Quality is very nice of this tablet. It is around 470 grams but when you carry in your hand it doesn't feel very heavy.Screen Quality:Though it has an IPS display the screen quality is pretty good. It has a very sharp color and brightness is also good. You can definitely enjoy watching videos in this tablet.Sound:The biggest advantage of this tablet is its 4 speakers. It produces a very nice sound output. It is loud enough to enjoy movies without any external Bluetooth speaker. It also supports Dolby audio so you will definitely enjoy the sound of this tablet.Camera Quality:It has an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. I am not impressed with the camera quality. For video calls, it is okay but doesn't expect that it will take photos like your smart phones.UI Experience:It comes with Android 10 and One UI 2.5. It's a very neat and clean UI with No bloatware. It comes with some pre-installed application but you can able to uninstall or disable it.Cons :I have found only cons in this tablet that it supports 15-watt fast charging but in the box, you will only get a 7.5-watt charger, so if you want to charge your tablet faster then you have to purchase a new 15-watt charger or any other mobile phone fast charger. In my case, I am using an 18-watt fast charger of Redmi."

It won't put a smile on your face, but it will do the job.",N/A,"I wanted a tab for studying from pdfs, watching videos and attending zoom meetings. Those three jobs it will do perfectly well. It will not multitask though, and if you are going to be spending a lot of time on chrome, browsing internet, you will start seeing lag. But for pdfs, videos and lectures you can buy it.Performance while using:1. CHROME: Definitely lags a little bit while browsing.2. READING PDFS: Crisp and smooth. Use ReadEra app for an amazing experience.3. YOUTUBE: Nice and smooth, no stutter, no lag.4. AUDIO: As others have mentioned, it is loud enough and good.5. DISPLAY: Strictly average. We have 5 phones in our family, from low range to mid range. All of them have better display than this.6. SWITCHING APPS: You will definitely notice the lag here. So you must know your usage. Are you using it for browsing facebook, chrome etc? Or for watching videos, pdfs etc.Not tried yet:1. VIDEO CALL: Will update.Bottom line is this is no Ferrari. If you are like me, and the only 4 apps you need are : ReadEra, Youtube, VLC and Zoom, this tab is good enough for you, you can buy it. But if you are going to use it like a phone - switching apps like crazy, scrolling infinitely etc. it won't work for you. You can buy the 32 GB ipad for that. It is not priced too far (26,000 vs 17,000).Personally, I am satisfied with the performance because I was not expecting much. One thing I am sorely disappointed with is the display quality. Expected much better from Samsung, which is known for its AMOLED displays."

THE Best Tablet under 20K",N/A,"Got the Wifi variant of the tablet. I was looking for a device which would help in:1) Casual tasks like email checking2) Documents reading3) Media consumption (very much)The tab just serves all my purpose and I am totally satisfied with it. The day to day tasks feel smooth and fast (one suggestion to make it feel more quicker is reduce the animations to 0.5x in the developer mode).The screen is good not the best one, viewing angles could have been better but again can't complain at the price point. Brightness though could have been more as the current high settings is okish for outdoor usage.The Speakers are AMAZING, can definitely feel the stereo audio output.

A sleek and powerful tablet for your entertainment and productivity",N/A,"I have been using the Lenovo Tab M8 HD Tablets for a few months now, and I am very impressed with its features and performance. This tablet is very sleek and lightweight, with a metal body and an 8-inch HD display. It has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which delivers crisp and clear visuals. It also has an IPS panel, which offers wide viewing angles and vivid colors. The tablet is very powerful, as it has a MediaTek Helio A22 processor, which can handle multiple tasks and apps smoothly. It also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB with a microSD card. The tablet runs on Android 9 Pie, which is fast and user-friendly. It also has a long battery life, as it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. The tablet is very versatile, as it has a Wi-Fi only connectivity, which allows me to browse the internet, stream videos, play games, and more. It also has a 5 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera, which are good for taking photos and video calls. It also has dual speakers with Dolby Audio, which provide rich and immersive sound. It also has a face unlock feature, which is convenient and secure. The tablet is also very affordable, compared to other tablets in the market. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a sleek and powerful tablet for their entertainment and productivity. It is a great product from Lenovo."

The tab works amazing. It has quite enough storage, you can manage easily along with your phone. Big screen, smooth touch, great audio and visuals. It's sleek and elegant. Camera quality is quite average. Rest features are amazing. Processor and the built quality is nice. Battery life will last long if you switch off the tab and keep safe when not in use.

For accessories, I got the green cover named 'Robustrion Deer Pattern Flip Stand Case for Lenovo M8 2nd Gen' and CEDO tempered glass from Appario retail itself. Both suit the tab perfectly.

The battery life is good and it took a couple of hours to charge fully. The Zoom app has some glitches with Android 10 but the web version works fine. Will update after a few more weeks of use.Update after one month of use: I continue to be overall happy with this product. Video and audio quality is very good. Battery life is very good. I watched a full 45-minute YouTube video on 2% power without the tablet dying. Battery charging is fairly fast, especially if you turn off WiFi during charge. Word processing through Google Docs works fine. Zoom loads properly now on the app. The camera placement during call is not ideal. It always looks like I'm looking to the side instead of directly into the screen. It's the same problem when tablet is horizontal or vertical. Overall, happy with the purchase."

This is gonna be a detailed feedback of this keyboard (after 40 days of extensive use for gaming and typing for around 6-7 hours a day)General Overlook:This is, according to Logitech, a kind of membrane-mechanical-hybrid - but is essentially a membrane keyboard. But, it's keys are tuned to deliver a full 4 mm bottom out distance and a consistent 50g actuation force (comparable to Cherry MX Blue and Brown). Thus, the keystrokes feel really close to a mechanical one, are tactile, and have good key-stroke recovery. However, though it is a really good sounding keyboard, it's not a mechanical. I am attaching a sound test video recorded with my phone's in-built microphone.Build:A decent build quality, not the best - but certainly feels good and durable. There is a slight bit of flex to the keyboard, but not something you will experience during daily use. My only real complain with build is that the wrist-rest should have been a magnetically attached (i.e, removable) and not fixed. The cable is braided and of really good quality. The keycaps are well-built and don't seem like they gonna show any wear soon.RGB -Great. Really good, bright and consistently lit RGB lighting that can be customized on a 5-zone basis. This does not have per key lighting like some other keyboards under Rs 4,000 but this gives you effects like screen-sampling and sync-to-audio. The G symbol on the top left is the cream on the top.Miscellaneous:The gaming mode toggle button and the dedicated media control keys are a really good feature to have at this price point. It supports anti-ghosting up to 5 keys; but I really wish they had added full anti-ghosting.VERDICT - Unless you strictly want a mechanical keyboard, this should be your go-to keyboard under the Rs 4,000 point. This is, in my opinion, a better buy overall than most mechanical keyboards at the price, because of Logitech's better build reputation, the 2-year limited hardware replacement policy (register the keyboard as a product on your profile on the Logitech website), and finally the feature-rich RGB."

A must have gaming keyboard for tech enthusiasts",N/A,"I recently had the chance to try out the Logitech G213 Prodigy USB Gaming Keyboard, and I have to say, it's been quite the gaming experience. Here's my mixed review of this gaming keyboard-The standout feature for me was the RGB lighting. The keyboard offers a stunning 16.8 million color options, which allows for a truly personalized and immersive gaming atmosphere. Whether you prefer a calm, cool blue or an intense, fiery red, the lighting customization possibilities are endless. It's a fantastic way to add some flair to your gaming setup, and it certainly enhances the overall aesthetic.The dedicated media controls are a real convenience. With the ability to play, pause, skip tracks, and adjust volume right from the keyboard, I found myself spending less time switching between applications and more time enjoying my games and multimedia. It's a small but meaningful feature that can make a big difference in your overall gaming experience.Customization is a big deal for gamers, and the Logitech G HUB software doesn't disappoint. You can tailor the lighting to match your mood or the aesthetics of your gaming rig. Additionally, the ability to create macros and program keys to your liking can be a game-changer for those who want to streamline complex in-game actions or productivity tasks.One of the surprising highlights was the sound of the keys. The keypresses are satisfyingly tactile and provide an audible click. For those who enjoy the auditory feedback while typing or gaming, the G213 Prodigy's key sounds are indeed a bonus.Overall for anyone looking to buy a durable keyboard under Rs. 5,000/= this is a great choice."

Perfect backlit keyboard under ‚Çπ5K",N/A,"I have tried many other backlit keyboards prior to trying this (all under ‚Çπ2K). The main reason I was reluctant was its price. It's expensive if you just want a backlit keyboard.Advantages -1. Backlit is only for keys and there's no light surrounding the keys. This helps a lot when you work in darkness as it reduces the over-all brightness around you.2. Backlit color not limited to 3 or 7. As they promise, there's a whole color palette to choose from. Choose any color, any shade with the software. Note that the software has to be downloaded from website of Logitech.3. Braided cables.4. Amount of key-travel is good.5. Keys are not tough nor very sensitive, I'll say just perfect.6. Multimedia keys - only the bare minimum ones that I need frequently. No useless macro keys to program and stuff.7. Prominent Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock and Windows Lock indicator.8. Has the context key on the right of spacebar. Useful if you want the context menu (the one you get by right-click of mouse) without touching mouse.Disadvantages -1. Once you configure the color for keyboard, the configuration is specific to the system on which the software is running. There's no on-board memory to store the color configuration.2. You can't customize color for individual keys. The keyboard is divided in 7 sections (3 sections in the alphabet side, 1 section in the middle where arrow keys are present and 1 section of num pad). Each section can have its own color.On the whole, worth the price and no regrets.If you're looking for a mechanical keyboard but don't have the budget to go above INR 5K, I would say, give this a shot. It's a membrane keyboard but I don't think that really counts as long as you enjoy using it.Edit: A few keys stopped working 2 months before the warranty expired and I got a new replacement within 2 weeks. But the new one doesn't have a braided cable :')"

But, it's keys are tuned to deliver a full 4 mm bottom out distance and a consistent 50g actuation force (comparable to Cherry MX Blue and Brown). Thus, the keystrokes feel really close to a mechanical one, are tactile, and have good key-stroke recovery. However, though it is a really good sounding keyboard, it's not a mechanical. I am attaching a sound test video recorded with my phone's in-built microphone.Build:A decent build quality, not the best - but certainly feels good and durable. There is a slight bit of flex to the keyboard, but not something you will experience during daily use. My only real complain with build is that the wrist-rest should have been a magnetically attached (i.e, removable) and not fixed. The cable is braided and of really good quality. The keycaps are well-built and don't seem like they gonna show any wear soon.RGB -Great. Really good, bright and consistently lit RGB lighting that can be customized on a 5-zone basis. This does not have per key lighting like some other keyboards under Rs 4,000 but this gives you effects like screen-sampling and sync-to-audio. The G symbol on the top left is the cream on the top.Miscellaneous:The gaming mode toggle button and the dedicated media control keys are a really good feature to have at this price point. It supports anti-ghosting up to 5 keys; but I really wish they had added full anti-ghosting.VERDICT - Unless you strictly want a mechanical keyboard, this should be your go-to keyboard under the Rs 4,000 point. This is, in my opinion, a better buy overall than most mechanical keyboards at the price, because of Logitech's better build reputation, the 2-year limited hardware replacement policy (register the keyboard as a product on your profile on the Logitech website), and finally the feature-rich RGB."

A must have gaming keyboard for tech enthusiasts",N/A,"I recently had the chance to try out the Logitech G213 Prodigy USB Gaming Keyboard, and I have to say, it's been quite the gaming experience. Here's my mixed review of this gaming keyboard-The standout feature for me was the RGB lighting. The keyboard offers a stunning 16.8 million color options, which allows for a truly personalized and immersive gaming atmosphere. Whether you prefer a calm, cool blue or an intense, fiery red, the lighting customization possibilities are endless. It's a fantastic way to add some flair to your gaming setup, and it certainly enhances the overall aesthetic.The dedicated media controls are a real convenience. With the ability to play, pause, skip tracks, and adjust volume right from the keyboard, I found myself spending less time switching between applications and more time enjoying my games and multimedia. It's a small but meaningful feature that can make a big difference in your overall gaming experience.Customization is a big deal for gamers, and the Logitech G HUB software doesn't disappoint. You can tailor the lighting to match your mood or the aesthetics of your gaming rig. Additionally, the ability to create macros and program keys to your liking can be a game-changer for those who want to streamline complex in-game actions or productivity tasks.One of the surprising highlights was the sound of the keys. The keypresses are satisfyingly tactile and provide an audible click. For those who enjoy the auditory feedback while typing or gaming, the G213 Prodigy's key sounds are indeed a bonus.Overall for anyone looking to buy a durable keyboard under Rs. 5,000/= this is a great choice."

Perfect backlit keyboard under ‚Çπ5K",N/A,"I have tried many other backlit keyboards prior to trying this (all under ‚Çπ2K). The main reason I was reluctant was its price. It's expensive if you just want a backlit keyboard.Advantages -1. Backlit is only for keys and there's no light surrounding the keys. This helps a lot when you work in darkness as it reduces the over-all brightness around you.2. Backlit color not limited to 3 or 7. As they promise, there's a whole color palette to choose from. Choose any color, any shade with the software. Note that the software has to be downloaded from website of Logitech.3. Braided cables.4. Amount of key-travel is good.5. Keys are not tough nor very sensitive, I'll say just perfect.6. Multimedia keys - only the bare minimum ones that I need frequently. No useless macro keys to program and stuff.7. Prominent Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock and Windows Lock indicator.8. Has the context key on the right of spacebar. Useful if you want the context menu (the one you get by right-click of mouse) without touching mouse.Disadvantages -1. Once you configure the color for keyboard, the configuration is specific to the system on which the software is running. There's no on-board memory to store the color configuration.2. You can't customize color for individual keys. The keyboard is divided in 7 sections (3 sections in the alphabet side, 1 section in the middle where arrow keys are present and 1 section of num pad). Each section can have its own color.On the whole, worth the price and no regrets.If you're looking for a mechanical keyboard but don't have the budget to go above INR 5K, I would say, give this a shot. It's a membrane keyboard but I don't think that really counts as long as you enjoy using it.Edit: A few keys stopped working 2 months before the warranty expired and I got a new replacement within 2 weeks. But the new one doesn't have a braided cable :')"

Despite being renewed, it looked and felt almost brand new. There were no noticeable scratches or dents, and the keyboard and touchpad were in excellent working order.Cost-Effective Option: Opting for a renewed laptop proved to be a wise financial decision. I saved a significant amount compared to buying a new one, yet the performance and overall quality have not been compromised. It provided me with great value for my money.Upgraded Features: The renewed laptop came with upgraded features that added to its appeal. The increased storage capacity and enhanced processor speed have significantly improved my productivity and overall user experience.Reliable Customer Support: Throughout the purchasing process, the customer support team was extremely helpful and responsive.

Nice Looks: It's a good-looking phone, for sure. People notice it.Short Battery Life: The battery doesn't last long, especially with 5G.Slow Charging: Even with the 18W charger, it takes a while to charge up.Okay Cameras: The cameras are decent. They take okay pictures, nothing fancy.In short, the Redmi 12 5G is a good phone with a speedy processor, nice looks, and okay cameras.

Overall good phone",N/A,Using it since few days. I am not heavy gamer or user.  I find this as a fair deal for overall smartihine usage. Battery backup is nice. Having 8gb RAM giving smooth app operating experience. Display and camera are average. Lightweight phone to carry.

Good in Budget",N/A,"Good at this price range, a budget phone does all your needs in a 5G phone, Memory at this price is super, display is quite big when you compare with the pro phones, the only thing, about is The camera though the company says its 50 megapixel, I don't like its Camera quality, all the pictures are comming very dark as compared to my previous Redmi phones, also it does not have the slower version to take vedio, for this you have to buy the Redmi note versions, but there you will sacrifice with the display, as in Redmi notes you will get the smaller display than this,...... Overall its a good phone at this budget but not satisfied with the camera quality, I will give this phone 7/10 rating............."

Amazing in Budget‚ù§Ô∏è",N/A,1.The looks of the phone definately stands out..with That glass backüòå2.Performance is also good as of now but it could be better through Updates..3.Camera is also decent..not so good not so bad4.Speaker quality is also quite good..it won't disappoint you despite being a mono speaker5.There is no issues in Call quality and Signal reception..6.Display is outstanding...but note that you can't play videos smoothly over 1080p7.It is a bit in the taller side...not so narrow..in hand feel isüëç8.No animations but it is still smooth..9. Charging speed is also quite good(roughly 2.5% in 3 min.)..and battery lasts around 7-8 hours in normal usage..overall it can last a day if you are a normal user..If you are looking for a budget 5g phone..this is one of the best for you..Will update it again after an update...

Below average mobile with high price",N/A,"HI lost my Infinix hot 8 mobile so bought this mobile as it is 5G. After 15 days of usage, its performance is below average compared to my previous Infinix mobile. Only good thing is 256 GB storage.  But again you cant extend it. Very frequently we stop getting calls and sms. We get to know this when someone makes whatsapp call to us and remind us. When we reboot mobile this problem is resolved. It has happened 3 times in 15 days. So its permanent problem of this mobile. Camera is very average, dont look at it as 50mp. Quality is just like any other 8mp. There is no front flash. Lot of ads you will find in this mobile and you need to research on internet how to disable all these useless ads and games. So compared to my old 6300 Infinix Hot8 mobile, this 15500 redmi mobile is not worth its cost. It would be good if sold under 8000."

Easy 5g device- good hotspot also",N/A,"I am enjoying 5g access for first time.This device is entry level by amazon and redmi collabration.I bought this for less than 8k with my old redmi 9a  exchange offer.Phone specs  for 4gb ram - I have good OTT apps and screen is good.Usage of 1.7Gb ram by OS is too much though.I hope upcoming updates fix this.Lock screen is finger print -Its good upgrade for me.Experience using other launcher and keypads - I use nova launcher and microsoft swift keypad- gesture control is blocked when you opt for third party launchers - keyboard looks perfect with big screen.There is 3 button at bottom which you cant remove.Bloatware is plenty - I didn't sign in google account immediately - I uninstall most apps.I feel battery drain with my 5g usage ,But yeah great  hotspot for my laptop or tablet.Gaming :Not much into gaming - I play crosswords , spelling games- hardly any issue when playing . This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted  to it.I have mic issues  when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If  looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up."

Easy 5g device- good hotspot also",N/A,"I am enjoying 5g access for first time.This device is entry level by amazon and redmi collabration.I bought this for less than 8k with my old redmi 9a  exchange offer.Phone specs  for 4gb ram - I have good OTT apps and screen is good.Usage of 1.7Gb ram by OS is too much though.I hope upcoming updates fix this.Lock screen is finger print -Its good upgrade for me.Experience using other launcher and keypads - I use nova launcher and microsoft swift keypad- gesture control is blocked when you opt for third party launchers - keyboard looks perfect with big screen.There is 3 button at bottom which you cant remove.Bloatware is plenty - I didn't sign in google account immediately - I uninstall most apps.I feel battery drain with my 5g usage ,But yeah great  hotspot for my laptop or tablet.Gaming :Not much into gaming - I play crosswords , spelling games- hardly any issue when playing . This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted  to it.I have mic issues  when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If  looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up."

Below average mobile with high price",N/A,"HI lost my Infinix hot 8 mobile so bought this mobile as it is 5G. After 15 days of usage, its performance is below average compared to my previous Infinix mobile. Only good thing is 256 GB storage.  But again you cant extend it. Very frequently we stop getting calls and sms. We get to know this when someone makes whatsapp call to us and remind us. When we reboot mobile this problem is resolved. It has happened 3 times in 15 days. So its permanent problem of this mobile. Camera is very average, dont look at it as 50mp. Quality is just like any other 8mp. There is no front flash. Lot of ads you will find in this mobile and you need to research on internet how to disable all these useless ads and games. So compared to my old 6300 Infinix Hot8 mobile, this 15500 redmi mobile is not worth its cost. It would be good if sold under 8000."

A sleek and powerful tablet for your entertainment and productivity",N/A,"I have been using the Lenovo Tab M8 HD Tablets for a few months now, and I am very impressed with its features and performance. This tablet is very sleek and lightweight, with a metal body and an 8-inch HD display. It has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which delivers crisp and clear visuals. It also has an IPS panel, which offers wide viewing angles and vivid colors. The tablet is very powerful, as it has a MediaTek Helio A22 processor, which can handle multiple tasks and apps smoothly. It also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB with a microSD card. The tablet runs on Android 9 Pie, which is fast and user-friendly. It also has a long battery life, as it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. The tablet is very versatile, as it has a Wi-Fi only connectivity, which allows me to browse the internet, stream videos, play games, and more. It also has a 5 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera, which are good for taking photos and video calls. It also has dual speakers with Dolby Audio, which provide rich and immersive sound. It also has a face unlock feature, which is convenient and secure. The tablet is also very affordable, compared to other tablets in the market. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a sleek and powerful tablet for their entertainment and productivity. It is a great product from Lenovo."

I used it for few minutes and it is very good. Camera is also good and decent. Screen quality is excellent. Nice clarity with hd display and sound is crystal clear with Dobly atom which keeps enhancing and auto adjusting the sound making it clear as day and works even better when plugged in using earphones or headphones.Overall it is a very good and promising product by lenovo. Lenovo has other tablets too..however price being affordable the tablet has good quality which should last for a long time compare to other tablets of lenovo and in this price. I would recommend everyone to go for it.Don't focus on reviews you will love the look and feel of it when you experience it."

Perfect model for students looking for a tab to buy for studies üëåüèª",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The tab works amazing. It has quite enough storage, you can manage easily along with your phone. Big screen, smooth touch, great audio and visuals. It's sleek and elegant. Camera quality is quite average. Rest features are amazing. Processor and the built quality is nice. Battery life will last long if you switch off the tab and keep safe when not in use.  Suggesting you to buy this 3GB 32GB one with WiFi+ LTE because that's the best. For accessories, I got the green cover named 'Robustrion Deer Pattern Flip Stand Case for Lenovo M8 2nd Gen' and CEDO tempered glass from Appario retail itself. Both suit the tab perfectly. You can go for the same. üôåüòá"

Used product & pathetic speed",N/A,"Sent a used and refurbished product. 1-yr warranty already expired a few months agoü§ÆAfter use of few months:Pathetic speed. Completely free memory with only 2-3 apps downloaded, it takes FORVER to switch between apps, for ex, when I want to copy text from Kindle app to my Note app. The note app NEVER loads fully.Usually the issue of low speed happens after years of use or lots of data storage but it is acting this way from the start. Pathetic."

Finally! Android 10 on Wi-Fi only tablet",N/A,"The Mediatek Helio A22 is not a very Powerfull Processor but it simply worked for me great.I had bought this tablet for Video Confering over Zoom, Google Meet and for Some Office works over MS Excel, MS Word, MS PowerPoint and few other Google Softwares and they work flawless without any lags.You simply attach any Keyboard and Mouse over the Micro USB and it will act as a Mini Laptop.The product is extremely sleek in design and handy to hold. The Metallic back gives it a premium look and feel.Supports 128gb of memory card and can also be extended with the help on a OTG Pendrive.The best part supports Dual Wifi Band (@2.4ghz and @5ghz) so you can a blazing fast speed.No Simcard Facility.The only con i feel is 5W Charger bundled in the box as it charges the tablet very slow, however i tried charging with A 10W charger and it charged pretty fast then a 5W.It has very narrow bezles which makes it feel very handy, you feel holding a 7inch tablet instead a 8inch tablet in your hand that how sleek and handy it is.A must buy product at Rs.9999/- for Day to Day minimalist Usage.This product was tough to find. It did not show up in regular searches and only appeared when searching for ""2nd generation."" If you want an Android 10 tablet and don't need SIM calling, this is the tablet! I bought this for basic tasks: writing and Web surfing. For writing, I have purchased a Bluetooth keyboard and added a mouse. I do not play games so have no comment on that. The battery life is good and it took a couple of hours to charge fully. The Zoom app has some glitches with Android 10 but the web version works fine. Will update after a few more weeks of use.Update after one month of use: I continue to be overall happy with this product. Video and audio quality is very good. Battery life is very good. I watched a full 45-minute YouTube video on 2% power without the tablet dying. Battery charging is fairly fast, especially if you turn off WiFi during charge. Word processing through Google Docs works fine. Zoom loads properly now on the app. The camera placement during call is not ideal. It always looks like I'm looking to the side instead of directly into the screen. It's the same problem when tablet is horizontal or vertical. Overall, happy with the purchase."

A Good Option for students upto class 12",N/A,"A Good tablet for upto 12 class students.1.CURRENT SITUATIONPresently,(July,2020) Two tablets have same reasonable price with that much same specifications. Lenovo M8 HD (2nd gen) and Samsung galaxy tab A8. You can choose any of them depending upon availability.2. Lenovo M8 vs Samsung galaxy A8 :A.

It also has a long battery life, as it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. The tablet is very versatile, as it has a Wi-Fi only connectivity, which allows me to browse the internet, stream videos, play games, and more.

A sleek and powerful tablet for your entertainment and productivity",N/A,"I have been using the Lenovo Tab M8 HD Tablets for a few months now, and I am very impressed with its features and performance. This tablet is very sleek and lightweight, with a metal body and an 8-inch HD display. It has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which delivers crisp and clear visuals. It also has an IPS panel, which offers wide viewing angles and vivid colors. The tablet is very powerful, as it has a MediaTek Helio A22 processor, which can handle multiple tasks and apps smoothly. It also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB with a microSD card. The tablet runs on Android 9 Pie, which is fast and user-friendly. It also has a long battery life, as it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. The tablet is very versatile, as it has a Wi-Fi only connectivity, which allows me to browse the internet, stream videos, play games, and more. It also has a 5 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera, which are good for taking photos and video calls. It also has dual speakers with Dolby Audio, which provide rich and immersive sound. It also has a face unlock feature, which is convenient and secure. The tablet is also very affordable, compared to other tablets in the market. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a sleek and powerful tablet for their entertainment and productivity. It is a great product from Lenovo."

Good tablet for affordable price",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I used it for few minutes and it is very good. Camera is also good and decent. Screen quality is excellent. Nice clarity with hd display and sound is crystal clear with Dobly atom which keeps enhancing and auto adjusting the sound making it clear as day and works even better when plugged in using earphones or headphones.Overall it is a very good and promising product by lenovo. Lenovo has other tablets too..however price being affordable the tablet has good quality which should last for a long time compare to other tablets of lenovo and in this price. I would recommend everyone to go for it.Don't focus on reviews you will love the look and feel of it when you experience it."

Perfect model for students looking for a tab to buy for studies üëåüèª",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The tab works amazing. It has quite enough storage, you can manage easily along with your phone. Big screen, smooth touch, great audio and visuals. It's sleek and elegant. Camera quality is quite average. Rest features are amazing. Processor and the built quality is nice. Battery life will last long if you switch off the tab and keep safe when not in use.  Suggesting you to buy this 3GB 32GB one with WiFi+ LTE because that's the best. For accessories, I got the green cover named 'Robustrion Deer Pattern Flip Stand Case for Lenovo M8 2nd Gen' and CEDO tempered glass from Appario retail itself. Both suit the tab perfectly. You can go for the same. üôåüòá"

Used product & pathetic speed",N/A,"Sent a used and refurbished product. 1-yr warranty already expired a few months agoü§ÆAfter use of few months:Pathetic speed. Completely free memory with only 2-3 apps downloaded, it takes FORVER to switch between apps, for ex, when I want to copy text from Kindle app to my Note app. The note app NEVER loads fully.Usually the issue of low speed happens after years of use or lots of data storage but it is acting this way from the start.

Good phone. Recommended",N/A,"Phone is really good. Only issue I found out is that it overheats upon video recording in both cameras simultaneously. Another good feature I noticed is that if phone is connected to a wifi network, personal hotspot in phone can be activated simultaneously. That means wifi data can be shared through this phone. Display is really good. The pre applied screen protector is a life saver. Saved my screen many times . Battery stays for a day with moderate usage. Calls are clear. Very rarely it freezes . Good inbuilt video editor. Themes are good. Didn't try gaming. UI is good. Call recording is not there. Charger is working ok. Other brand chargers are not supported for rapid charging.

Best smartphone for eyes",N/A,"Got my package on time. Packaging was very good. Package contained one HONOR 90 smartphone, one transparent cover, one USB type C cable, a sim trey ejector tool and some documents. But no charger yet. Phone had a good quality screen protector fixed on it's screen. Premium looks with jitter or lag free smooth and fast operation, very very good picture quality and above all the best part is it's display. WOW! Not only gorgeous display but also very easy on eyes, with hours and hours of usage even at night and in completely dark room! After using big brands of smartphones like iPhone and Samsung, and many other brands like vivo and realme, my search for smartphone to relief my eye strain during it's use ends finally with HONOR 90.

Be careful with the seller.

The eye comfort feature proves invaluable, particularly at night, ensuring minimal strain on your eyes.-The user interface (UI) stands out as the finest I've encountered. It mirrors the smooth functionality of Apple's UI while offering an array of additional features. Moreover, it comes with very less bloatware.-The camera excels, delivering top-notch photo quality under optimal lighting conditions. While it may falter slightly in indoor and nighttime settings, it handles portraits exceptionally well. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with its performance.Major drawbacks include:Lack of provided charger: The absence of a charger with the device poses a significant inconvenience. Without the original charger, fast charging is not possible, even with a 66W charger. Additionally, the original charger is unavailable in the Indian market, necessitating a potential wait for its availability. In the meantime, users may resort to using an MI 33W charger, which takes approximately 2 hours for a full charge. It's advisable to avoid using cheap charger brands as they could adversely affect the battery life in the long term.Heating issues: There appears to be a heating problem, particularly noticeable when using the camera or engaging in moderate gaming sessions such as playing Clash of Clans.Battery life concerns: Some users have reported rapid battery discharge, although it still lasts a full day for normal usage patterns."

Best Mid Premium at this Price Range!",N/A,"I have been using this Honor 90, and I want to share my overall experience with this device. One thing I can say for sure is that HONOR 90 will be the best pick for this Great Indian Festival.1) Display: First I‚Äôm very impressed with the display quality of HONOR 90. The quad-curved floating screen with a 1.5K AMOLED display is a treat for our eyes, and the second one is the most important 3840 Hz PWM. This is something I wasn‚Äôt aware of but after spending nights with this phone at low brightness, I got to know how earlier I got strain on my eyes but with HONOR 90 I easily spent time without worrying about my eyes. The low blue light filter is also different than other phones because generally, I remember the screen used to get really yellow due to which I used to turn off the eye filter. But this phone does it with hardware I think which is why it practically looks like a normal screen while also reducing blue light.2) Camera: My camera experience on rear 200MP & front 50MP cameras has a great optimization to provide an amazing output. The combination of the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 ISP, the camera sensor, and the Honor Image Optimization seems great to me. The best thing I love the most is that it has a lot of features and AI vlogging is something that makes great moments in a snap. I love to shoot videos, and I always knew that only iPhones do the best video, but this phone has such good video experience along with so many features which even not there on iphone, like dual camera video at the same time.3) Processor: Snapdragon 7 Gen1 soc is not only highly power efficient due to its 4nm fabrication tech but at the same time it's very capable of handling our daily and heavy tasks too. I never felt any performance drop or any issue with this device in my daily use. I used to do gaming, do my office work, watch content on OTT, and obviously call and social media in my daily use.4) UI: Above all this, the highly optimized and smooth UI is highly feature-rich at the same time to provide a great user experience, and the best part it‚Äôs a bloatware-free experience. The phone feels super smooth like butter due to the very smooth app opening and closing animation. I like the overall software experience.5) Battery: 5000mAh is more than enough, it simply gives a day of usage with 20-30% remaining. It almost gives me 6-7 hours of SOT in high to moderate usage. When it comes to charging it easily charges in 70 mins from 20-100%.For me, it's a complete mid-premium package at this price point. This brand tried to provide a wonderful experience and according to me, they did it well."

Good display and aesthetics but buggy software",N/A,"the camera quality is awesom and display and aesthetics are good compare to other er phones in this range,ALERT!However the OS is pathetic, phone randomly locks up and stops responding and reboots itself without any error. Too much frustrating. This defeats the very purpose of having a phone, if phone reboots intermittently than you can't trust it.Price is high compared to other phones. Battery is average and not that great compared to other 5000 mah battery phones. No charger in the box. However if you have Oneplus warp charger 65 watts then it charges 100% within 50 minutes."

Good phone. Recommended",N/A,"Phone is really good. Only issue I found out is that it overheats upon video recording in both cameras simultaneously. Another good feature I noticed is that if phone is connected to a wifi network, personal hotspot in phone can be activated simultaneously. That means wifi data can be shared through this phone. Display is really good. The pre applied screen protector is a life saver. Saved my screen many times . Battery stays for a day with moderate usage. Calls are clear. Very rarely it freezes . Good inbuilt video editor. Themes are good. Didn't try gaming. UI is good. Call recording is not there. Charger is working ok. Other brand chargers are not supported for rapid charging. They should have provided a better charger adapter. Camera quality is good .onscreen fingerprint sensor is good. Don't know about service centres. no issues so far. Make sure to use a good screen guard always . Bought this on launch day itself."

Best smartphone for eyes",N/A,"Got my package on time. Packaging was very good. Package contained one HONOR 90 smartphone, one transparent cover, one USB type C cable, a sim trey ejector tool and some documents. But no charger yet. Phone had a good quality screen protector fixed on it's screen. Premium looks with jitter or lag free smooth and fast operation, very very good picture quality and above all the best part is it's display. WOW! Not only gorgeous display but also very easy on eyes, with hours and hours of usage even at night and in completely dark room! After using big brands of smartphones like iPhone and Samsung, and many other brands like vivo and realme, my search for smartphone to relief my eye strain during it's use ends finally with HONOR 90. I am writing this review after using it more than two weeks since I received it."

Be careful with the seller. The phone has some good qualities but also a few manageable downsides.",N/A,"Do not trust the seller; they are sending returned products that do not come with the original company packaging.Speaking about the advantages and disadvantages of the phone.Main Pros:-The display is exceptional, boasting flagship quality that will leave you in awe of its beauty. The eye comfort feature proves invaluable, particularly at night, ensuring minimal strain on your eyes.-The user interface (UI) stands out as the finest I've encountered. It mirrors the smooth functionality of Apple's UI while offering an array of additional features. Moreover, it comes with very less bloatware.-The camera excels, delivering top-notch photo quality under optimal lighting conditions. While it may falter slightly in indoor and nighttime settings, it handles portraits exceptionally well. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with its performance.Major drawbacks include:Lack of provided charger: The absence of a charger with the device poses a significant inconvenience. Without the original charger, fast charging is not possible, even with a 66W charger. Additionally, the original charger is unavailable in the Indian market, necessitating a potential wait for its availability. In the meantime, users may resort to using an MI 33W charger, which takes approximately 2 hours for a full charge. It's advisable to avoid using cheap charger brands as they could adversely affect the battery life in the long term.Heating issues: There appears to be a heating problem, particularly noticeable when using the camera or engaging in moderate gaming sessions such as playing Clash of Clans.Battery life concerns: Some users have reported rapid battery discharge, although it still lasts a full day for normal usage patterns."

Best Mid Premium at this Price Range!",N/A,"I have been using this Honor 90, and I want to share my overall experience with this device. One thing I can say for sure is that HONOR 90 will be the best pick for this Great Indian Festival.1) Display: First I‚Äôm very impressed with the display quality of HONOR 90. The quad-curved floating screen with a 1.5K AMOLED display is a treat for our eyes, and the second one is the most important 3840 Hz PWM. This is something I wasn‚Äôt aware of but after spending nights with this phone at low brightness, I got to know how earlier I got strain on my eyes but with HONOR 90 I easily spent time without worrying about my eyes. The low blue light filter is also different than other phones because generally, I remember the screen used to get really yellow due to which I used to turn off the eye filter. But this phone does it with hardware I think which is why it practically looks like a normal screen while also reducing blue light.2) Camera: My camera experience on rear 200MP & front 50MP cameras has a great optimization to provide an amazing output. The combination of the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 ISP, the camera sensor, and the Honor Image Optimization seems great to me. The best thing I love the most is that it has a lot of features and AI vlogging is something that makes great moments in a snap. I love to shoot videos, and I always knew that only iPhones do the best video, but this phone has such good video experience along with so many features which even not there on iphone, like dual camera video at the same time.3) Processor: Snapdragon 7 Gen1 soc is not only highly power efficient due to its 4nm fabrication tech but at the same time it's very capable of handling our daily and heavy tasks too. I never felt any performance drop or any issue with this device in my daily use. I used to do gaming, do my office work, watch content on OTT, and obviously call and social media in my daily use.4) UI: Above all this, the highly optimized and smooth UI is highly feature-rich at the same time to provide a great user experience, and the best part it‚Äôs a bloatware-free experience. The phone feels super smooth like butter due to the very smooth app opening and closing animation. I like the overall software experience.5) Battery: 5000mAh is more than enough, it simply gives a day of usage with 20-30% remaining. It almost gives me 6-7 hours of SOT in high to moderate usage. When it comes to charging it easily charges in 70 mins from 20-100%.For me, it's a complete mid-premium package at this price point. This brand tried to provide a wonderful experience and according to me, they did it well."

Good phone. Recommended",N/A,"Phone is really good. Only issue I found out is that it overheats upon video recording in both cameras simultaneously. Another good feature I noticed is that if phone is connected to a wifi network, personal hotspot in phone can be activated simultaneously. That means wifi data can be shared through this phone. Display is really good. The pre applied screen protector is a life saver. Saved my screen many times . Battery stays for a day with moderate usage. Calls are clear. Very rarely it freezes . Good inbuilt video editor. Themes are good. Didn't try gaming. UI is good. Call recording is not there. Charger is working ok. Other brand chargers are not supported for rapid charging. They should have provided a better charger adapter. Camera quality is good .onscreen fingerprint sensor is good. Don't know about service centres. no issues so far. Make sure to use a good screen guard always . Bought this on launch day itself."

Best smartphone for eyes",N/A,"Got my package on time. Packaging was very good. Package contained one HONOR 90 smartphone, one transparent cover, one USB type C cable, a sim trey ejector tool and some documents. But no charger yet. Phone had a good quality screen protector fixed on it's screen. Premium looks with jitter or lag free smooth and fast operation, very very good picture quality and above all the best part is it's display. WOW! Not only gorgeous display but also very easy on eyes, with hours and hours of usage even at night and in completely dark room! After using big brands of smartphones like iPhone and Samsung, and many other brands like vivo and realme, my search for smartphone to relief my eye strain during it's use ends finally with HONOR 90. I am writing this review after using it more than two weeks since I received it."

Be careful with the seller. The phone has some good qualities but also a few manageable downsides.",N/A,"Do not trust the seller; they are sending returned products that do not come with the original company packaging.Speaking about the advantages and disadvantages of the phone.Main Pros:-The display is exceptional, boasting flagship quality that will leave you in awe of its beauty. The eye comfort feature proves invaluable, particularly at night, ensuring minimal strain on your eyes.-The user interface (UI) stands out as the finest I've encountered. It mirrors the smooth functionality of Apple's UI while offering an array of additional features. Moreover, it comes with very less bloatware.-The camera excels, delivering top-notch photo quality under optimal lighting conditions. While it may falter slightly in indoor and nighttime settings, it handles portraits exceptionally well. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with its performance.Major drawbacks include:Lack of provided charger: The absence of a charger with the device poses a significant inconvenience. Without the original charger, fast charging is not possible, even with a 66W charger. Additionally, the original charger is unavailable in the Indian market, necessitating a potential wait for its availability. In the meantime, users may resort to using an MI 33W charger, which takes approximately 2 hours for a full charge. It's advisable to avoid using cheap charger brands as they could adversely affect the battery life in the long term.Heating issues: There appears to be a heating problem, particularly noticeable when using the camera or engaging in moderate gaming sessions such as playing Clash of Clans.Battery life concerns: Some users have reported rapid battery discharge, although it still lasts a full day for normal usage patterns."

Best Mid Premium at this Price Range!",N/A,"I have been using this Honor 90, and I want to share my overall experience with this device. One thing I can say for sure is that HONOR 90 will be the best pick for this Great Indian Festival.1) Display: First I‚Äôm very impressed with the display quality of HONOR 90. The quad-curved floating screen with a 1.5K AMOLED display is a treat for our eyes, and the second one is the most important 3840 Hz PWM. This is something I wasn‚Äôt aware of but after spending nights with this phone at low brightness, I got to know how earlier I got strain on my eyes but with HONOR 90 I easily spent time without worrying about my eyes. The low blue light filter is also different than other phones because generally, I remember the screen used to get really yellow due to which I used to turn off the eye filter. But this phone does it with hardware I think which is why it practically looks like a normal screen while also reducing blue light.2) Camera: My camera experience on rear 200MP & front 50MP cameras has a great optimization to provide an amazing output. The combination of the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 ISP, the camera sensor, and the Honor Image Optimization seems great to me. The best thing I love the most is that it has a lot of features and AI vlogging is something that makes great moments in a snap. I love to shoot videos, and I always knew that only iPhones do the best video, but this phone has such good video experience along with so many features which even not there on iphone, like dual camera video at the same time.3) Processor: Snapdragon 7 Gen1 soc is not only highly power efficient due to its 4nm fabrication tech but at the same time it's very capable of handling our daily and heavy tasks too. I never felt any performance drop or any issue with this device in my daily use. I used to do gaming, do my office work, watch content on OTT, and obviously call and social media in my daily use.4) UI: Above all this, the highly optimized and smooth UI is highly feature-rich at the same time to provide a great user experience, and the best part it‚Äôs a bloatware-free experience. The phone feels super smooth like butter due to the very smooth app opening and closing animation. I like the overall software experience.5) Battery: 5000mAh is more than enough, it simply gives a day of usage with 20-30% remaining. It almost gives me 6-7 hours of SOT in high to moderate usage. When it comes to charging it easily charges in 70 mins from 20-100%.For me, it's a complete mid-premium package at this price point. This brand tried to provide a wonderful experience and according to me, they did it well."

Most overall satisfactory product in its category.",N/A,"Reviewing this after 24 hrs on using the product. After going thru various options in same category, found this to be the most affordable and complete overall package. Got the Wi-Fi 4gb+64gb variant. First of all the display resolution capped at 1080p is satisfactory does the job, for videos on streaming apps and youtube, display may be a letdown. Regards to software, on 15th Jan'23, recieved Android 13 update, works smoothly. Multi tasking is good and works flawlessly. Dont compare it with Samsung Smartphones as basic features like haptic feedback are missing from UI. As far as build and fit and finish its is very good, back panel is of metal and has matt finish, not too thick but sleek enuf. The screen size of 10+ inches is not easy to handle with one hand but feels comfortable with 2 hands and is quite manageable in landscape mode. The UI overall is very smooth and is well optimised for tablets unlike other brands. Cameras both front and back are above average. All around bezels are well uniform, front camera is in landscape mode. Made a good choice as many tablets in this category either have good display, or latest Android version or smooth UI. But this Samsung A8 fits the bill and checks all the right boxes. Go for it as it is a Samsung after all. Overall satisfied. Thank you Amazon and Samsung."

Thankfully Samsung has stepped up their game, which is a good thing for my peace of mind. I bought this tablet many many months ago for my mother, because her main use case include reading scripts from ancient apocrypha and watching the most obscure YouTube videos known to mankind.

That being said you're not here to listen to me vent, so let's get to the point.[Display] - 4/5It's a 10.5 inch TFT panel that carries the exceptional Samsung display quality.

The resolution is 1920x1200 which is more than enough for consuming content on a screen of this size, this includes YouTube videos, games and books. That being said this display is quite excessive for boomers who will only use the tablet for reading, you can do better buy buying a tablet half the price.I saw a few students asking if this tablet supports the S-Pen on forums, I tested it out and no S-Pen is not supported. But I did find a few videos and posts that show people using those capacitive stylus to take notes in S-Pen and do some art. Also there is no Dex available for this tablet so keep that in mind for those that are using the tablet for studies.[Connectivity] - 5/5It has wifi and Bluetooth, literally all you need for home use. The connections are snappy and I haven't faced any issues setting it up, my mom haven't faced any issues either, despite her claiming that Bluetooth will cause cancer...[Performance and Storage] - 4/5I mean I am only giving 4/5 because it looks more critical. I don't use this device to properly stress test i, I did try playing some games on it and it seemed pretty snappy, I didn't download PUBG because my mother isn't a budding eSports pro based in Noida. It has an ""Octa Core Processor"" which is mot probably based on Unisoc architecture(arguably less reliable than Exynos and Qualcomm but that doesn't matter for light users like boomers). The most action this tablet sees is when my mother uses the Facebook app. I bought the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage version because it is more than enough for my mother, I might add a 128GB SD card just in case she decides to install WhatsApp on it. 4GB RAM is more than enough for almost all modern applications and use cases, sure in 2023 8GB is the norm, but the tablet has not slowed down even a bot for my mother. I honestly wouldn't recommend you but this tablet for gaming if that is your primary use case.[Camera] - 3.5/5This is the crux of the usage for boomers, an absolute make or break situation, and honestly this tablet passes with flying colors. The front camera is positioned on the side allowing your eyes and face to be centered in a video call while the tablet is in landscape mode. This is a big win, and honestly places the tablet leagues ahead of the competition which will make you look schizophrenic during video calls as your eyes dash from side to side away from the camera.  The front facing camera is 5MP and Samsung's software does a good enough job to make sure the image quality is good, I tested out a video call with my mother and the quality was very good in mediocre lighting. The rear camera is 8MP and does a very good job in scanning documents and for the average boomer, provides a good enough picture quality for those emergency neighborhood landfill photos.I would say this is also more than enough for students who require a table to attend their online classes, because the teach ain't going to care if you look like handsome squidward. All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.[Software] - 5/5As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad,  then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).[Battery] - 5/5It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.[Conclusion] - 4.5/5For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended.

All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.[Software] - 5/5As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad,  then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).[Battery] - 5/5It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.[Conclusion] - 4.5/5For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended. Though if software us not a problem then you really can't go wrong with this tablet."

TA Trustworthy Companion for Everyday Use",N/A,"I've been using the Samsung Tab A8 for the past few months, and I must say, Samsung has yet again proven itself as a trustworthy brand. This tablet, while not a powerhouse, impressively handles basic functions such as entertainment, light gaming, and file management.Pros:1. **Best UI Experience:** Samsung's One UI provides a smooth and user-friendly interface, making the tablet a joy to navigate.2. **3 Years of Software Update Confirmation:** Samsung's commitment to providing software updates for three years ensures your device remains secure and up-to-date.3. **Good File Management System and Knox Security:** The tablet excels in file management, and Samsung's Knox security adds an extra layer of protection.4. **Big Display with Good Build Quality:** The tablet boasts a generous display and solid build quality, enhancing the overall user experience.5. **Quad Speakers with Very Loud Sound:** The audio experience is excellent with four speakers that deliver loud and clear sound, perfect for entertainment and multimedia.Cons:1. *TFT Display Feels Washed Out:* While the display is sizable, the use of a TFT panel results in colors that may feel less vibrant compared to other display technologies.2. *Slow Charging with Included Charger:* The tablet's bundled 7.5V charger, despite supporting 15V fast charging, extends the charging time to 3-4 hours, which can be a bit of a drawback.3. *Heavier Than expected:* The tablet is on the heavier side, which may not be ideal for extended one-handed use or portability.In conclusion, the Samsung Tab A8 is a reliable choice for those seeking a tablet for everyday tasks. It might not be a top-tier performer, but its well-rounded features, secure software support, and quality user interface make it a commendable option for users who prioritize trustworthiness and functionality over cutting-edge specifications."

Great",N/A,"After lot of comparison, settled for this. Happy. Works greats, seamlessly in playing small games, great camera. But display color may be a little toned down but it's good for the eyes, since i got it for kid's school studies and long hours learning watching youtube. Good audio and battery life. Call voice quality is brilliant, so clear. 10.5 is correct size as it is measured diagonally. Don't go for smaller ones. Lenovo P11 seems equally good or even better overall esp display, but settled for Samsung's reliability and service network. Happy."

Worth the money",N/A,"What i like about A8-> Its slim-> Metallic finish-> Looks premium-> Its fast enough for me, able to play most of the games and look into my notes.-> Popup feature and shortcuts are good.-> Battery life , will last more than a day if under normal usage (Excluding Gaming and watching high resolution videos)-> Sound quality is awesome-> Netflix can render HD Quality videos-> 64 Gb is enough for me , as im not into gaming on Tab-> great for studies.-> close to stock android (Compared with google Pixel), did not see any bloat wear other than those apps of Samsung.Things which could have been better-> Fast charging (takes more than an hour to fully charge -- close to 2 hours)-> No Sim feature , hence no calling feature-> its heavy-> Bezels could have been more thinner-> Screen quality is good , but not great when compared to smart phones. But in par with other Tabs in the price segment .-> Camera quality is OK OK , in par with other tabs in the price segment.No regrets after buying the Tab, Its fast enough and gets the job done. Happy with what Samsung has provided."

Most overall satisfactory product in its category.",N/A,"Reviewing this after 24 hrs on using the product. After going thru various options in same category, found this to be the most affordable and complete overall package. Got the Wi-Fi 4gb+64gb variant. First of all the display resolution capped at 1080p is satisfactory does the job, for videos on streaming apps and youtube, display may be a letdown. Regards to software, on 15th Jan'23, recieved Android 13 update, works smoothly. Multi tasking is good and works flawlessly. Dont compare it with Samsung Smartphones as basic features like haptic feedback are missing from UI. As far as build and fit and finish its is very good, back panel is of metal and has matt finish, not too thick but sleek enuf. The screen size of 10+ inches is not easy to handle with one hand but feels comfortable with 2 hands and is quite manageable in landscape mode. The UI overall is very smooth and is well optimised for tablets unlike other brands. Cameras both front and back are above average. All around bezels are well uniform, front camera is in landscape mode. Made a good choice as many tablets in this category either have good display, or latest Android version or smooth UI. But this Samsung A8 fits the bill and checks all the right boxes. Go for it as it is a Samsung after all. Overall satisfied. Thank you Amazon and Samsung."

Beautiful experience",N/A,"Pros:1. Screen size of 10‚Äù+ at this price point is a very Good point!2. Performance is good!3. The speakers are amazing!4. Knox Security included5. Enough detailing to the tab and it feels so premium in hand!Cons:1. Samsung could have got an AMOLED into this price‚Ä¶2. S-pen support or stylus support lacks in this device!3. Supports fast charging but gets a 8W charger out of the box, takes a healthy time to fill the juice!One extra note : Kuddos to team samsung for the screen, I have used A7 and now A8 initially without any cover not a single bit of scratch I noticed in the screen! Build is top notch"

Exceptional Performance and Value with Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3",N/A,"I recently purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 powered by an Intel Core i5-11320H processor, and it has been an absolute delight. This laptop has exceeded my expectations in many ways, making it an excellent choice for both work and leisure.First and foremost, the performance of this laptop is top-notch. Thanks to the combination of the SSD and ample RAM, it operates smoothly and quickly, handling multiple tasks with ease. Whether it's for gaming, streaming, or working on intensive projects, the IdeaPad Gaming 3 doesn't miss a beat.The build quality and design are also worth mentioning. It's a well-constructed machine that feels sturdy and reliable, something I can see myself using for the next 5 years without concern. The aesthetics are pleasing, with a design that strikes a nice balance between a gaming and professional look.While the webcam is just okay, it's certainly adequate for work-related video calls and casual chats. It's not the highlight of this laptop, but it serves its purpose well enough for me to get my work done without any major complaints.When it comes to value for money, the Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 is a fantastic investment. Considering its performance capabilities, build quality, and the features it offers, the price point is very reasonable. It's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, high-performing laptop that won't break the bank.The display deserves a special mention as well. It provides clear, vibrant visuals that enhance the gaming experience and make watching videos a pleasure. The color accuracy and brightness levels are impressive, adding to the overall enjoyment of using this laptop.In conclusion, the Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 with an Intel Core i5-11320H processor is an outstanding laptop that offers great performance, durability, and value. It's a versatile machine that meets the needs of gamers, professionals, and everyday users alike.

So below are some good and bad points about this laptop based on my experience.Good:- Graphics is good and you feel really good while playing games or watching movies. It's really fast, build quality is also good. It's cooling system works good and till now I didn't faced any heating issue even when playing heavy games.Bad:- It's speaker is good but not upto what i expected it to be. Considering it's a gaming laptop and the price, I want it's speaker to be little bit more better. But the biggest disappointed I have with this laptop is it's battery backup which really sucks. On default settings, it gives not even 1hr of battery backup which it seriously not acceptable.Overall, it's a good laptop if you don't have power issues at your home."

So below are some good and bad points about this laptop based on my experience.Good:- Graphics is good and you feel really good while playing games or watching movies. It's really fast, build quality is also good. It's cooling system works good and till now I didn't faced any heating issue even when playing heavy games.Bad:- It's speaker is good but not upto what i expected it to be. Considering it's a gaming laptop and the price, I want it's speaker to be little bit more better. But the biggest disappointed I have with this laptop is it's battery backup which really sucks. On default settings, it gives not even 1hr of battery backup which it seriously not acceptable.Overall, it's a good laptop if you don't have power issues at your home."

Great Value For Money",N/A,"It's a great value for money product within this price range, after checking multiple options I feel like this ticked all the boxes for me. Since I do light gaming this is good enough to run Valorant and CS without a problem at 144 FPS, paired with the 144 Hz monitor I get a smooth experience. The only thing I feel needs a little improvement is the camera."

Exceptional Performance and Value with Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3",N/A,"I recently purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 powered by an Intel Core i5-11320H processor, and it has been an absolute delight. This laptop has exceeded my expectations in many ways, making it an excellent choice for both work and leisure.First and foremost, the performance of this laptop is top-notch. Thanks to the combination of the SSD and ample RAM, it operates smoothly and quickly, handling multiple tasks with ease. Whether it's for gaming, streaming, or working on intensive projects, the IdeaPad Gaming 3 doesn't miss a beat.The build quality and design are also worth mentioning. It's a well-constructed machine that feels sturdy and reliable, something I can see myself using for the next 5 years without concern. The aesthetics are pleasing, with a design that strikes a nice balance between a gaming and professional look.While the webcam is just okay, it's certainly adequate for work-related video calls and casual chats. It's not the highlight of this laptop, but it serves its purpose well enough for me to get my work done without any major complaints.When it comes to value for money, the Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 is a fantastic investment. Considering its performance capabilities, build quality, and the features it offers, the price point is very reasonable. It's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, high-performing laptop that won't break the bank.The display deserves a special mention as well. It provides clear, vibrant visuals that enhance the gaming experience and make watching videos a pleasure. The color accuracy and brightness levels are impressive, adding to the overall enjoyment of using this laptop.In conclusion, the Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 with an Intel Core i5-11320H processor is an outstanding laptop that offers great performance, durability, and value. It's a versatile machine that meets the needs of gamers, professionals, and everyday users alike. I'm thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and powerful laptop."

Got it for 42240/-. The operation system is home edition, which is not good for a gaming pc. Upgrade it to pro version.

Love the phone but missing couple of basic feature options",N/A,"For the price of 8999 this is truly an amazing phone in terms of performance, smoothness weight and comfortability to use. I exchanged this with a Redmi 9A and compared to that this device is 100 times better.The camera is amazing, battery backup is fantastic and charging is super fast. There are no lags when switching apps and there are many useful features which are seen in Moto phones that I could find on this device.Having said that I was surprised to find some basic features missing or complicated compared to Samsung or Redmi phones.- There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.- There is no option to create folder or group icons together. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. For example all your UPI apps will be mixed up all over the app drawer and cannot be grouped under a single folder in this device. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit. I have to say that this device at 8999 outperforms my 15000 Samsung in every aspect.I only hope they will take care of the missing or convoluted basic feature issues that I mentioned before to make this phone a true super hero!."

Honest review and pros and cons",N/A,"Here is my honest review of the realme narzo N53 smartphone:Pros:Fast charging - The 33W fast charging allows the phone's 5,000 mAh battery to charge very quickly. realme claims it can charge to 50% in just 28 minutes.Slim design - At 7.99mm thick, realme says this is the slimmest phone in its price segment. The featherweight design makes it comfortable to hold.90Hz display - The 6.6"" FHD+ display has a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and transitions. Good for gaming and multimedia.Decent hardware - It has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage which is decent hardware for the price. Gaming performance should be smooth.Cons:Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options."

Good according the price range",N/A,The mobile is good according the price range. The camera is good according to the price. In starting battery back up is arround 1-2 days but after some time the battery back up will be maximum 1 day. The charging is fast 33W charger. Overall The mobile is good according to the price range but if you do gaming mobile will start getting little heat and the game will not run smoothly so the mobile is not for heavy games but small games can run easily and the other things are also good so for the normal work mobile is good according to the price range.

Google maps navigation in C53 Narzo not working out of the box like Realme C33",N/A,"First of all I am thankful that a TPU-Case was included, since there is none availabe from any third-party-vendors anywhere online, supposedly because the phone is so new. Overall I am very satisfied with the the phone RealMe Narzo C53 and it has replaced at the moment my  2 years old phone costing more than 5x times more when bought. Out of the box Google maps navigation is not working. Search on Google for ""maps not working on Realme phone"". Solution: Realme UI Go Edition: Settings > Permission Manager > Privacy > Location and switch on the location service of the phone (same problem was with Realme C33, which I bought earlier from Realme Store). This phone has no Location Service On-Button in the top as it is usual in other phones. Other than that it's a really beautiful phone, for me even better than the large competitor lookalike , because it has a expandable memory-slot (I am using 128 MB card, 1 TB memory card is too expensive at the moment and 2 TB memory card I believe has not been developed yet). Haven't found out how to access the 2nd Black & White camera. I have the 128 GB/ 6 GB RAM version. Realme should adopt this design to all phones that will be issued in the future. Very beautiful design. I went on launch-day at launch-time 14:00 to the Realme Flagship Store, which is in walking distance of my residence, but they said it's not available off-line in any store, You have to order it online from amazon or Realme itself, I ordered it online from inside the store, where they kindly offered me a chair. Delivery by amazon was excellent on next day. If I would have been 8 seconds faster at 14:00 on launch-day, then I would have received it on launch day by amazon same-day delivery. As always I paid via creditcard in advance. I will launch video or photos later...and update the review after some time gaining  more usage experience."

Google maps navigation in C53 Narzo not working out of the box like Realme C33",N/A,"First of all I am thankful that a TPU-Case was included, since there is none availabe from any third-party-vendors anywhere online, supposedly because the phone is so new. Overall I am very satisfied with the the phone RealMe Narzo C53 and it has replaced at the moment my  2 years old phone costing more than 5x times more when bought. Out of the box Google maps navigation is not working. Search on Google for ""maps not working on Realme phone"". Solution: Realme UI Go Edition: Settings > Permission Manager > Privacy > Location and switch on the location service of the phone (same problem was with Realme C33, which I bought earlier from Realme Store). This phone has no Location Service On-Button in the top as it is usual in other phones. Other than that it's a really beautiful phone, for me even better than the large competitor lookalike , because it has a expandable memory-slot (I am using 128 MB card, 1 TB memory card is too expensive at the moment and 2 TB memory card I believe has not been developed yet). Haven't found out how to access the 2nd Black & White camera. I have the 128 GB/ 6 GB RAM version. Realme should adopt this design to all phones that will be issued in the future. Very beautiful design. I went on launch-day at launch-time 14:00 to the Realme Flagship Store, which is in walking distance of my residence, but they said it's not available off-line in any store, You have to order it online from amazon or Realme itself, I ordered it online from inside the store, where they kindly offered me a chair. Delivery by amazon was excellent on next day. If I would have been 8 seconds faster at 14:00 on launch-day, then I would have received it on launch day by amazon same-day delivery. As always I paid via creditcard in advance. I will launch video or photos later...and update the review after some time gaining  more usage experience."

Pretty great for the price range",N/A,"It's a pretty good phone considering the price. Battery is very long lasting and charges quite quickly as well. Sound quality is good, UI is good. Camera quality is decent, you can get nice photos in good light.I have had some instances of the phone glitching but it lasts only a couple seconds and resolves easily.The phone build is nice but it may be slightly on the heavier side. Fingerprint sensor works great. It's definitely a good phone and I'd recommend getting it if your budget is under 10,000."

Basic features are missing...",N/A,"There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.- There is no option to private storagefor photo and videos. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit."

Honest review and pros and cons",N/A,"Here is my honest review of the realme narzo N53 smartphone:Pros:Fast charging - The 33W fast charging allows the phone's 5,000 mAh battery to charge very quickly. realme claims it can charge to 50% in just 28 minutes.Slim design - At 7.99mm thick, realme says this is the slimmest phone in its price segment. The featherweight design makes it comfortable to hold.90Hz display - The 6.6"" FHD+ display has a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and transitions. Good for gaming and multimedia.Decent hardware - It has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage which is decent hardware for the price. Gaming performance should be smooth.Cons:Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options."

Ok ok",N/A,as it is low budget tablet. The feature is limitet not much more fun. Some feature is not working perfactly like multi window featurse. No font change option. Only one font exist. Face unlock is very poor. Power button is in wrong place. It is irritating and at the time of holding tablet power button is presed unwanted. Battery back up is ok no heating issue. Charger is taking 3:30 to 4 hour to full charged. Sond quality is very loud. Prossesor is poor. Internernet speed was slow.  Camera qualty is ok.

Best overall in 65k",N/A,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."

Should you buy this? YES but....",N/A,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à.

If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant."

Best 4600h laptop under 70k!",N/A,"UPDATE:So Amazon has updated the invoice with serial number in it and given it to me via email.FULL REVIEW as I promised:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great(subjective), hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited."

High performing laptop. Brightness is somewhat low at 250 nits.",N/A,"The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth. Have to test some games yet. The only issue is that the brightness is on the lower side. If you're okay with that, look no further, this laptop is for you. The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect. For example, this laptop is versatile i.e., can be used at work too as it doesn't have that vulgar gamer look with RGB and shit. Looks stealthy, elegant, and minimalistic.I will be back with a detailed review.Edit 1: Gaming - Played battlefield 1 on this machine. Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode. Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions. Fan noise is not disturbing too.Edit 2: Played Far Cry 5 on my legion. The game can be run at up to the highest settings, but I opted high and getting 65 fps steadily on average. Again the GPU temperatures don't go above 62‚Å∞C. Some serious cooling!Edit 3: Back with more insight! Valorant runs at an average of 150 fps which is more than anyone can ask for. But it comes at an expense of temperatures which can go to 68 degrees which is not that bad. But still, I used the fps limiter to limit it at 85 fps resulting in cooler 58 degrees. Win-Win for all xD.Also, the speakers on this laptop are great. Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too. The keyboard is derived from Thinkpad which means it's awesome for any work you throw at it. Keystrokes are clicky and tactile with anti-ghosting enabled.Also a tip, please make a restore point on the external hard drive using macrium reflect immediately after buying. These windows updates can f#*$ up your lovely legion 5. If possible avoid them completely.Will try more recent demanding games and come back. Cheers."

Beautiful laptop for the price, go for it",N/A,"Have been using this laptop for close to 3 months now and here is my reviewPros:-Mux switchDecent CPU and GPU pairing120Hz Display with adequate coloursAmazing feel and decent build qualityBeautiful KeyboardFunction KeysCons:-Average battery life, It is a gaming laptop after all, with The hybrid mode on and moderate screen brightness and with quiet mode on, the max i was able to get was 6 hours. This is with watching movies and in a meeting. However as mentioned above there are so many conditions, if you run it with everything cranked to the max you get a max of 1 hour.As you can see, the laptop is quite good, especially for a budget and on the move, the speciality of this laptop is that this laptop has a mux switch which genuinely gives you all the power of your GPU and lets you enjoy that high refresh rate.The laptop has a 128 GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, and the os is installed on the solid state drive, therefore quick boot times.For gamesValorant : 120 FPS all highGTA 5: 55 FPS Average Very High settingsGOW: 27 FPS High settings (with stutter)Battery: 6/10Display and Camera: 9/10Build Quality, Keyboard and Trackpad: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (NVMe ssd btw)Overall: 8.5/10"

Beast in this price range...",N/A,"Updated to win 11 just after the delivery.Using this device continuosly for 12 hrs and I am playing games like Dota 2, Apex legends and Cs go.This device is absolutely Beast. No heating, no fan noise, no lagg and no frame drop.Harman audio is a cherry on top.Coming to the software Lenovo Vantage gives you various choices of system mode. Hybrid mode is the one I personally love cz I work on it too.Display is good, crisp and colour accuracy is on point.Lots of additional features like FN lock key, Camera shutter, 4 usb ports, 170 w charger etc.Design is fantastically engineered and the build quality is awesome. You can compare the designing with some of the most expensive gaming laptops like ROG strix and Dell G15.However, there are few downside like no RGB keyboard, average battey backup and it is heavy but I definitely consider worth my money in this price range. I cannot compromise quality over few additional specs.Display - 4Performance- 5Looks/Build - 5Battery- 3Value for money - 5Total - 4.6/5"

Best overall in 65k",N/A,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."

Should you buy this? YES but....",N/A,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à.

The battery can be charged from 0 to 50% in just 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver when you're on the go or need a quick top-up before a gaming session.In conclusion, the Lenovo Legion 5 is an amazing gaming laptop that excels in display quality, storage, RAM capacity, keyboard design, performance, and charging speed. If you're looking for a powerful and reliable gaming machine, I highly recommend giving the Lenovo Legion 5 a try. You won't be disappointed!"

This is with watching movies and in a meeting. However as mentioned above there are so many conditions, if you run it with everything cranked to the max you get a max of 1 hour.As you can see, the laptop is quite good, especially for a budget and on the move, the speciality of this laptop is that this laptop has a mux switch which genuinely gives you all the power of your GPU and lets you enjoy that high refresh rate.The laptop has a 128 GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, and the os is installed on the solid state drive, therefore quick boot times.For gamesValorant : 120 FPS all highGTA 5: 55 FPS Average Very High settingsGOW: 27 FPS High settings (with stutter)Battery: 6/10Display and Camera: 9/10Build Quality, Keyboard and Trackpad: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (NVMe ssd btw)Overall: 8.5/10"

Beast in this price range...",N/A,"Updated to win 11 just after the delivery.Using this device continuosly for 12 hrs and I am playing games like Dota 2, Apex legends and Cs go.This device is absolutely Beast. No heating, no fan noise, no lagg and no frame drop.Harman audio is a cherry on top.Coming to the software Lenovo Vantage gives you various choices of system mode. Hybrid mode is the one I personally love cz I work on it too.Display is good, crisp and colour accuracy is on point.Lots of additional features like FN lock key, Camera shutter, 4 usb ports, 170 w charger etc.Design is fantastically engineered and the build quality is awesome. You can compare the designing with some of the most expensive gaming laptops like ROG strix and Dell G15.However, there are few downside like no RGB keyboard, average battey backup and it is heavy but I definitely consider worth my money in this price range.

Best overall in 65k",N/A,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."

Should you buy this? YES but....",N/A,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à. I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this? If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant."

Best 4600h laptop under 70k!",N/A,"UPDATE:So Amazon has updated the invoice with serial number in it and given it to me via email.FULL REVIEW as I promised:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great(subjective), hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited."

High performing laptop. Brightness is somewhat low at 250 nits.",N/A,"The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth. Have to test some games yet. The only issue is that the brightness is on the lower side. If you're okay with that, look no further, this laptop is for you. The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect. For example, this laptop is versatile i.e., can be used at work too as it doesn't have that vulgar gamer look with RGB and shit. Looks stealthy, elegant, and minimalistic.I will be back with a detailed review.Edit 1: Gaming - Played battlefield 1 on this machine. Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode. Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions. Fan noise is not disturbing too.Edit 2: Played Far Cry 5 on my legion. The game can be run at up to the highest settings, but I opted high and getting 65 fps steadily on average. Again the GPU temperatures don't go above 62‚Å∞C. Some serious cooling!Edit 3: Back with more insight! Valorant runs at an average of 150 fps which is more than anyone can ask for. But it comes at an expense of temperatures which can go to 68 degrees which is not that bad. But still, I used the fps limiter to limit it at 85 fps resulting in cooler 58 degrees. Win-Win for all xD.Also, the speakers on this laptop are great. Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too. The keyboard is derived from Thinkpad which means it's awesome for any work you throw at it. Keystrokes are clicky and tactile with anti-ghosting enabled.Also a tip, please make a restore point on the external hard drive using macrium reflect immediately after buying. These windows updates can f#*$ up your lovely legion 5. If possible avoid them completely.Will try more recent demanding games and come back. Cheers."

The Lenovo Legion 5 - A Gaming Powerhouse with Exceptional Features",N/A,"I recently got my hands on the Lenovo Legion 5 AMD Ryzen 5 4600H 15.6"" (39.62 cm) FHD IPS Gaming Laptop (8GB/1TB HDD + 256GB SSD/4GB NVIDIA GTX 1650/120Hz Refresh/Windows 10/Backlit Keyboard/Phantom Black/2.3Kg), 82B500BHIN, and I am beyond impressed with this gaming powerhouse.

Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited."

High performing laptop. Brightness is somewhat low at 250 nits.",N/A,"The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth. Have to test some games yet. The only issue is that the brightness is on the lower side. If you're okay with that, look no further, this laptop is for you. The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect. For example, this laptop is versatile i.e., can be used at work too as it doesn't have that vulgar gamer look with RGB and shit. Looks stealthy, elegant, and minimalistic.I will be back with a detailed review.Edit 1: Gaming - Played battlefield 1 on this machine. Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode. Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions. Fan noise is not disturbing too.Edit 2: Played Far Cry 5 on my legion. The game can be run at up to the highest settings, but I opted high and getting 65 fps steadily on average. Again the GPU temperatures don't go above 62‚Å∞C. Some serious cooling!Edit 3: Back with more insight! Valorant runs at an average of 150 fps which is more than anyone can ask for. But it comes at an expense of temperatures which can go to 68 degrees which is not that bad. But still, I used the fps limiter to limit it at 85 fps resulting in cooler 58 degrees. Win-Win for all xD.Also, the speakers on this laptop are great. Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too. The keyboard is derived from Thinkpad which means it's awesome for any work you throw at it. Keystrokes are clicky and tactile with anti-ghosting enabled.Also a tip, please make a restore point on the external hard drive using macrium reflect immediately after buying. These windows updates can f#*$ up your lovely legion 5. If possible avoid them completely.Will try more recent demanding games and come back. Cheers."

This is with watching movies and in a meeting. However as mentioned above there are so many conditions, if you run it with everything cranked to the max you get a max of 1 hour.As you can see, the laptop is quite good, especially for a budget and on the move, the speciality of this laptop is that this laptop has a mux switch which genuinely gives you all the power of your GPU and lets you enjoy that high refresh rate.The laptop has a 128 GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, and the os is installed on the solid state drive, therefore quick boot times.For gamesValorant : 120 FPS all highGTA 5: 55 FPS Average Very High settingsGOW: 27 FPS High settings (with stutter)Battery: 6/10Display and Camera: 9/10Build Quality, Keyboard and Trackpad: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (NVMe ssd btw)Overall: 8.5/10"

Beast in this price range...",N/A,"Updated to win 11 just after the delivery.Using this device continuosly for 12 hrs and I am playing games like Dota 2, Apex legends and Cs go.This device is absolutely Beast. No heating, no fan noise, no lagg and no frame drop.Harman audio is a cherry on top.Coming to the software Lenovo Vantage gives you various choices of system mode. Hybrid mode is the one I personally love cz I work on it too.Display is good, crisp and colour accuracy is on point.Lots of additional features like FN lock key, Camera shutter, 4 usb ports, 170 w charger etc.Design is fantastically engineered and the build quality is awesome. You can compare the designing with some of the most expensive gaming laptops like ROG strix and Dell G15.However, there are few downside like no RGB keyboard, average battey backup and it is heavy but I definitely consider worth my money in this price range. I cannot compromise quality over few additional specs.Display - 4Performance- 5Looks/Build - 5Battery- 3Value for money - 5Total - 4.6/5"

Best overall in 65k",N/A,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."

Should you buy this? YES but....",N/A,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à. I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this? If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant."

Best 4600h laptop under 70k!",N/A,"UPDATE:So Amazon has updated the invoice with serial number in it and given it to me via email.FULL REVIEW as I promised:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great(subjective), hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.

I cannot compromise quality over few additional specs.Display - 4Performance- 5Looks/Build - 5Battery- 3Value for money - 5Total - 4.6/5"

Best overall in 65k",N/A,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."

Should you buy this? YES but....",N/A,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à. I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this? If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant."

Best 4600h laptop under 70k!",N/A,"UPDATE:So Amazon has updated the invoice with serial number in it and given it to me via email.FULL REVIEW as I promised:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great(subjective), hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited."

High performing laptop. Brightness is somewhat low at 250 nits.",N/A,"The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth. Have to test some games yet. The only issue is that the brightness is on the lower side. If you're okay with that, look no further, this laptop is for you. The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect. For example, this laptop is versatile i.e., can be used at work too as it doesn't have that vulgar gamer look with RGB and shit. Looks stealthy, elegant, and minimalistic.I will be back with a detailed review.Edit 1: Gaming - Played battlefield 1 on this machine. Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode. Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions. Fan noise is not disturbing too.Edit 2: Played Far Cry 5 on my legion. The game can be run at up to the highest settings, but I opted high and getting 65 fps steadily on average. Again the GPU temperatures don't go above 62‚Å∞C. Some serious cooling!Edit 3: Back with more insight! Valorant runs at an average of 150 fps which is more than anyone can ask for. But it comes at an expense of temperatures which can go to 68 degrees which is not that bad. But still, I used the fps limiter to limit it at 85 fps resulting in cooler 58 degrees. Win-Win for all xD.Also, the speakers on this laptop are great. Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too. The keyboard is derived from Thinkpad which means it's awesome for any work you throw at it. Keystrokes are clicky and tactile with anti-ghosting enabled.Also a tip, please make a restore point on the external hard drive using macrium reflect immediately after buying. These windows updates can f#*$ up your lovely legion 5. If possible avoid them completely.Will try more recent demanding games and come back. Cheers."

The Lenovo Legion 5 - A Gaming Powerhouse with Exceptional Features",N/A,"I recently got my hands on the Lenovo Legion 5 AMD Ryzen 5 4600H 15.6"" (39.62 cm) FHD IPS Gaming Laptop (8GB/1TB HDD + 256GB SSD/4GB NVIDIA GTX 1650/120Hz Refresh/Windows 10/Backlit Keyboard/Phantom Black/2.3Kg), 82B500BHIN, and I am beyond impressed with this gaming powerhouse.

This is with watching movies and in a meeting. However as mentioned above there are so many conditions, if you run it with everything cranked to the max you get a max of 1 hour.As you can see, the laptop is quite good, especially for a budget and on the move, the speciality of this laptop is that this laptop has a mux switch which genuinely gives you all the power of your GPU and lets you enjoy that high refresh rate.The laptop has a 128 GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, and the os is installed on the solid state drive, therefore quick boot times.For gamesValorant : 120 FPS all highGTA 5: 55 FPS Average Very High settingsGOW: 27 FPS High settings (with stutter)Battery: 6/10Display and Camera: 9/10Build Quality, Keyboard and Trackpad: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (NVMe ssd btw)Overall: 8.5/10"

Good phone with little hiccups, Horrible battery experience",N/A,"Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain."

But I haven't tested while playing games. Normal usage no heating may be due to the weather in Hyderabad very chilled now 20 degrres only.Mobile is very fast while opening applications and other activities.No lags till now in 14 days.This is my 3rd review and I will date second review after 30 days of my usage.Still need to stabilize screen brightness in some applicationsScreen refresh rate is good and to be updated for some applicationsDay to day usage no issues at  all.Charging complete in just 30 to 35 minutes.Complete full day battery life guaranteed for normal usage including insta, facebook and X Twitter usage.Without cover mobile looks very good , handy and light weightNotifications are good on screen example when u place order in zomato, swiggy it shows on screen arrival notification continuously..

Very good mid range Phone.",N/A,Both Front and back Camera Quality is absolutely amazing. Best Screen Quality. Best Sound Quality. The best in Looks. Looks so premium like iPhone. Superfast Charging Capability.Only drawback I found by using this phone from past 14 days is that battery drains fast. But I feel it's not a matter of concern as charging is superfast but I guess it may not be suitable for heavy mobile users or  for those who play games in phone most of the time.

I was scared and in a moment i thought of cancelling the mobile.But i received the mobile and used for 1week and i didnt see any battery draining issues. Battery was really good, may be through updates it got changed i think. But battery was really good. Charging speed also good.If i use my mobile continuously i am getting 8hours of screen on time. For a normal user they can easily use a dayI do play games and mobile is handling very well.Overall it is a good mobile. But camera should be improved and ois should be improved."

Good product with average battery life",N/A,"Likes:1) Build quality is premium with glass front and back.2) Processor & RAM are fast for the application.3) Screen is of good quality with dynamic refresh rate.4) Camera performance good. But low light photo on wide angle camera is average or below average.5) 80W charger bundled in the box, charges the phone very quickly.6) Alert slider very convenient.Dislikes:1) Quite a few pre-installed one plus apps. Not all are very useful.2) Battery life is very average for a phone with 5000mAh battery. Also noticed that idle drain of the battery is very high."

Perfect mid range Smart Phone",N/A,"Writing this review after 7 months of usage. And I have been using multiple mobile devices in parallel but this one I kept for my personal use.Camera is great, Ram management is nice, software is clean and smooth. You get 3 years of OS updates on this. Battery is good, not great but fast charging is a bliss. Full charge in 30 mins.It doesn‚Äôt disappoint you in any segment."

Awesome Phone at 38000 ruppees, Display fantastic, Camera Fantastic, overall awesome",N/A,"Pretty awesome phone under 40k, Maybe the Oneplus 11r is even better, but the only differences between these are the curved display(the display is the same in both, but here it's flat, there it's curved), back design, and Processor. Mediatek Dimensity 9000 works fantastic for even hardcore games. The display is super smooth, super large, and crystal clear. The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland."

Good phone with little hiccups, Horrible battery experience",N/A,"Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain."

Very good mid range Phone.",N/A,Both Front and back Camera Quality is absolutely amazing. Best Screen Quality. Best Sound Quality. The best in Looks. Looks so premium like iPhone. Superfast Charging Capability.Only drawback I found by using this phone from past 14 days is that battery drains fast. But I feel it's not a matter of concern as charging is superfast but I guess it may not be suitable for heavy mobile users or  for those who play games in phone most of the time.

Good product with average battery life",N/A,"Likes:1) Build quality is premium with glass front and back.2) Processor & RAM are fast for the application.3) Screen is of good quality with dynamic refresh rate.4) Camera performance good. But low light photo on wide angle camera is average or below average.5) 80W charger bundled in the box, charges the phone very quickly.6) Alert slider very convenient.Dislikes:1) Quite a few pre-installed one plus apps. Not all are very useful.2) Battery life is very average for a phone with 5000mAh battery. Also noticed that idle drain of the battery is very high."

Perfect mid range Smart Phone",N/A,"Writing this review after 7 months of usage. And I have been using multiple mobile devices in parallel but this one I kept for my personal use.Camera is great, Ram management is nice, software is clean and smooth. You get 3 years of OS updates on this. Battery is good, not great but fast charging is a bliss. Full charge in 30 mins.It doesn‚Äôt disappoint you in any segment."

Awesome Phone at 38000 ruppees, Display fantastic, Camera Fantastic, overall awesome",N/A,"Pretty awesome phone under 40k, Maybe the Oneplus 11r is even better, but the only differences between these are the curved display(the display is the same in both, but here it's flat, there it's curved), back design, and Processor. Mediatek Dimensity 9000 works fantastic for even hardcore games. The display is super smooth, super large, and crystal clear. The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland."

Good phone with little hiccups, Horrible battery experience",N/A,"Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain."

But I haven't tested while playing games. Normal usage no heating may be due to the weather in Hyderabad very chilled now 20 degrres only.Mobile is very fast while opening applications and other activities.No lags till now in 14 days.This is my 3rd review and I will date second review after 30 days of my usage.Still need to stabilize screen brightness in some applicationsScreen refresh rate is good and to be updated for some applicationsDay to day usage no issues at  all.Charging complete in just 30 to 35 minutes.Complete full day battery life guaranteed for normal usage including insta, facebook and X Twitter usage.Without cover mobile looks very good , handy and light weightNotifications are good on screen example when u place order in zomato, swiggy it shows on screen arrival notification continuously..

Very good mid range Phone.",N/A,Both Front and back Camera Quality is absolutely amazing. Best Screen Quality. Best Sound Quality. The best in Looks. Looks so premium like iPhone. Superfast Charging Capability.Only drawback I found by using this phone from past 14 days is that battery drains fast. But I feel it's not a matter of concern as charging is superfast but I guess it may not be suitable for heavy mobile users or  for those who play games in phone most of the time.

Good Mobile",N/A,"I have seen reviews after ordering the mobile. In most of the reviews everyone was saying about the battery problem. I was scared and in a moment i thought of cancelling the mobile.But i received the mobile and used for 1week and i didnt see any battery draining issues. Battery was really good, may be through updates it got changed i think. But battery was really good. Charging speed also good.If i use my mobile continuously i am getting 8hours of screen on time. For a normal user they can easily use a dayI do play games and mobile is handling very well.Overall it is a good mobile. But camera should be improved and ois should be improved."
